I lost my phone in December 2023, according to vodafone, they cannot see this insurance being included in my monthly bills, tried to make a claim today 14/2/24 to order a new phone, lady on the phone said to me because I no longer have the handset to insure and because they cannot see any mention on the monthly bills I have been paying insurance, they are having to remove the insurance from my account, but if I've NOT been paying insurance, then surely how can they remove it, if I haven't got insurance so there would be nothing to remove?!?! I have put in so many complaints to the customer service's team and hear absolutely nothing back, I've been without a phone since Dec 2023 and even after speaking with the upgrade team to see if that's an option, they're vague and rude on the phone and it feels as though no one wants to help. Worst customer service EVER and even worse mannerisms on the phone from the staff, nothing short of a crap experience! Will NEVER EVER use them EVER again once the contract has ended in Sept 2024. Will NOT be upgrading with Vodafone simply due to the incompetence of the staff and the phone signal is terrible! My sister told me to never use them and I didn't listen, oh how wrong was I!

From day one, when engineers from Kelly Communicatuioins arrived to do the cabelling they left without finishing the job. Between them and OpenReach and Vodafone there appeared to be zero communication...the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing. After a week of helpline calls to India, Egypt and one other country, the problem was still not resolved. (I would like to compliment all the staff in India and Egypt for their friendliness even though they could not resolve the issues). After cancelling my contract, and having received at least two emails from Vodafone to say they would send a package for me to return their equipment, nothing arrived in the post. I ended up taking the equipment to my local Vodfone shop. I sent a letter by post (recordrd/signed for) to the head of Vodafone to try and resolve issues but did not receive a reply. Avoid Vodafone at all costs. Having cancelled the Vodafone contract, I signed up with Virgin Media and the whole process ran like clockwork. My wi-fi was up and running within 90 mins of the engineer arriving. # Signed up for fastest fibre broadband‚Ä¶",Positive,0.032589285714285716

I was then told to go to a Samsung store where the fix is quick and can be done then and there. I spend money I don't have going to this store only to be told that they need it for 4 days and can't take it without me booking an appointment. Went to another Vodafone store mid-panic attack where they couldn't do a thing. Can't call because - oh yes - the device keeps restarting.

After discussing that my property is eligible for full fibre we then agreed on a package and price and settled on that, bear in mind it took nearly 2 hours but I was ok with that. I was told to check the progress on the update website if I needed more info. Anyways, a few days went past and my next door neighbour who also signed up with Vodafone full fibre said that his order got cancelled on the website. So I put in my order number in and found out that mine was cancelled as well! So I rang them up and after getting transferred to different departments and 2 hours in we finally sorted it out, jobs a good‚Äôun. But wait it doesn‚Äôt end there, I checked again after a few days and it got cancelled again! My next door neighbour who signed up 2 days after me is going live this week coming and has already received his equipment ( my house is in the middle of a row of terraced houses) and another neighbour 4 doors down is on sky full fibre. So I was going to ring them after work but I received a message saying your broadband has been cancelled and that I cannot receive full fibre at this address.

I received a msg to contact customer service the last time I posted the review. However they are as much use as a chocolate tea pot. I have now cancelled my phone contract as I honestly cannot afford to spend any more time speaking to incompetent staff. I never want to have anything to do with Vodafone ever again!!!!Went into Kingston Upon Thames branch and spoke to Vinay who managed to totally mess up a transfer of bank account details. This should be a simple task however he created 2 separate accounts and set up a pay as you go sim. Definitely not what I request. I have spend 3 days trying to sort this out. Every time I call I am told something different. No one seems to know what they are doing at all.

I specifically inquired about the implications of such a reset and was assured that only the password would revert to default settings. Unfortunately, this guidance was misleading as the reset erased all my customized settings, leaving me with the task of reconfiguring everything from scratch.This incident highlights a critical need for clearer communication and accurate information from customer support. It's disheartening to face additional hurdles due to incomplete advice. I hope my feedback encourages the company to improve their support process, ensuring future customers receive comprehensive and precise guidance to avoid similar frustrations.Moving forward, I urge the company to provide detailed instructions and support for backing up and restoring settings before recommending a factory reset. Customer trust relies heavily on the quality of support provided, and there's definitely room for improvement based on my recent experience.****************************************************If your support had informed me in advance about the issues that could arise after a factory reset or had followed up on the work, I would have opted not to address the previous problem of insufficient download/upload speeds. This is because the issue of the router losing its settings after a factory reset is more significant than the problem of inadequate download/upload speeds. Currently, all my Wi-Fi network devices are unusable. # I recently experienced a significaMisleading Factory Reset Advice Led to Lost Settingsnt‚Ä¶",Positive,0.15291666666666667

Amazingly and most surprisingly I have had to come and update because Vodafone (and I believe the agent was Jasmine - THANK YOU!) have - in an unusual turn of events - absolutely COME THROUGH!I was feeling so cynical and jaded about this situation (see below) but they not only cleared his file, they also updated it immediately and within one day, his credit score has been redeemed. He has gone from POOR to EXCELLENT over night and I can only say thank you to the team who actually sorted this out. It‚Äôs easy to lose hope in big business but in this case, Vodafone have put things right. With integrity, I can only raise to four stars because it has been a to-do and it could have been much more efficient and precious time, energy and emotional output could have been saved‚Ä¶But I am still very grateful and my prayers have been answered. Thank you. üôè OLD REVIEW:Unfortunately, Vodafone have really let us down. My stepson took out a contract nearly three years ago with a cooling off period and he returned the phone to them within the 14 days. They continued to try to take money (¬£70) from his account at the time despite the contract having stopped. He has been unaware of a ¬£36 debt that has now been defaulting for nearly three years since. He and his wife and new baby are on the verge of a move to the UK from abroad for Isaiah to start a new job and he opened his credit report to find that his low score was NOT (as he had thought) for being out of the country and not on the electoral roll but because of a ¬£36 debt to Vodafone that he was unaware of.With a 5.5 hour time difference and very slow responses from Vodafone AND mixed messages about his credit file (with one person on FB saying there was NOTHING he could do while another on Instagram was saying he COULD file a dispute and that they COULD look at his credit file) he paid the outstanding debt on 30th Jan and raised a dispute.However, a further failing from Vodafone has meant that his credit report has been updated on Feb 1st (2 days after paying the outstanding and debatable default) and it is STILL THERE!!! With the credit report on Experian reporting that he has defaulted AGAIN‚Ä¶ which he has not!!!Anyone who knows the current market in the UK knows that a watertight credit report is - understandably - essential for a landlord‚Äôs peace of mind and he is stuck with this apparent default (which no longer exists but has rolled on for yet another month on his record) and a ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù on his credit report because Vodafone have still not responded nor updated his details to Experian, Equifax and Transunion. This is such poor customer service. I am dumbfounded and so saddened.He is due to start his new job in the UK next month and is saddled with a ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù issue on his credit report because Vodafone have not updated his credit file despite him having paid the ¬£36.I am so concerned for my dear family and new baby grandson and so disappointed that Vodafone have let them down over such a piffling situation. It puts them in such a vulnerable situation with potential landlords and he has done due diligence to sort it out.The many five star reviews suggest stellar customer service‚Ä¶ but this is clearly reserved for those taking out a contract - there is no such speed and accuracy when it comes to helping to sort out a situation when someone has been wronged.Disappointed is an under statement.PLEASE sort this out Vodafone for the sake of a young family who need a break. # Miscarriage of justice (part 3)",Positive,0.09109294919639747

Over 18 months ago my wife and I decided to move to Thailand to live a nomad lifestyle. I understand that vodafone doesn't cover Thailand under my red max unlimited contract. I asked if it could be paused until I return.It couldn't, but I completely understand as I signed a contract, I continue to pay the bill and run the contract out. But, i asked for it to be cancelled as soon as the contract was up (around 12 months). 18 months later and I notice double the amount coming out of my bank account every month from vodafone. After an arduous conversation with their chat bot, i finally got hold of a real person. I ask for the contract to finally be cancelled and the number moved to pay-as-you-go... but it will cost me another month of rolling contract (that isn't used as the sim line is still turned off on my phone) as I have to give 30 days notice. I mentioned that I gave them 18 months notice, but no record of this conversation can now be found. And they wouldn't investigate until after the contract had been cancelled... So i'm now well over ¬£1400 deep to Vodafone for a service I haven't used with yet another month to pay out of contract.

I signed up for a business broadband contract with Vodafone last October 2023 and every single month till today I have spent over an hour on the phone with customer services to reactive my broadband which was suspended because the direct debit setup and the whole account setup were never completed properly. I have never once received an email or text regarding my account nor a statement in writing via email or post. I have requested these every time I call in but they can readily find my account (after over 7 questions). This is not the frustrating part, as a business every time the broadband is suspended, we are unable to take card payments or bookings for a day or two. Every phone call takes over an hour to resolve the issue, today I spent over 2hrs on the phone with customer services, and each time I had to negotiate an extra ¬£5 charge for late payment due to an error on their side. I have decided to go to another provider because there seems to be no one willing and able to help, including managers who promised a callback but never happened. I hope this helps anyone thinking of signing a contract with Vodafone. # I will give ZERO review if possible",Negative,-0.020378151260504195

Vodafone instructed the engineer, who came and dug up my garden laying the new fibre cable and then they cancelled the order again. Currently I have a cable connected to nothing? In the end I chose not to order broadband for a 5th time through Vodafone as I was disgusted with their customer service, when I complained I had no joy. Vodafone would not offer any compensation for time wasted as I was not a customer (yet!).I chose to go with a different provider, who thankfully turned up and installed the product- this was 5 months after I began the process with Vodafone.

But credit score rating is affected, of course.Following this review, Vodafone staff contacted me to resolve issue. However, in spite of the debt collector being able to contact me easily, it seems, Vodafone was not able to 'link' my name and details to the account....still claiming I had an account, but they could not resolve issues, as they could not connect any of my details they used as security questions to this account....Wow! # Poor practices with linked child account",Negative,-0.02619047619047619

My worst experience every with broadband provider, am so happy for EE. I had vodafone broadband for 2 years than I moved home. I have never missed a payment. When I moved and called to inform them about this I was told I would need a new router as my old one would no longer work. My contract was up anyway so my plan was to start a new contract . I asked them to cancel my current account since the router would not work at my new address and I was told I have an outstanding bill to clear , which means I would be paying for an entire month even though I would not have access to the Internet for that entire month. I was not happy with this so I spoke to a manager and he said me would credit my account the difference.       I waited for the new router they attempted a delivery but I was at work. The next day it was delivered to an address I was living at years ago. So I called to speak to them about it and nothing was done so I called and cancelled the account because I could not wait on the WiFi for over a month and nothing. After this I started getting bills. I called again to explain to them I already cancelled the order I do not have Internet access so I can't owe them money for service I am not receiving. Everytime I called I would be on the phone for hours , I was told all was sort. Weeks later I got letter in the posts regarding outstanding bills and how it will go on record to negatively affect my credit score. I called them again was on the phone for over 3 hours explaining the entire situation again like a broken record. I asked to speak to a manager again as I was so frustrated, everyone I spoke to had a different story as to why I have a balance on my account. When I finally spoke to a manager he told me a different balance than what was in the letter I received. He explained that apart of the balance was for my new account,for which I did not get the router and cancelled the account and the rest as for my old account which I also cancelled and already paid my final bill. He further stated that he would credit my account to take off the amount due on my new account since I did not get the router but he would have to go back and listen to all my calls to find out which of their employees told me I would not be charged again after I paid my last bill. I literally did not know whether to laugh at the rubbish I was hearing or cry over the amount of hours of my time they wasted and them trying to ruin my credit score over their own incompetence. The manager stated that it would take him a few days to listen to my calls so I won't know anything yet. I will continue to tell my story to anyone willing to listen. And i intend to take further actions. RUBBISH called customer service. # READ BEFORE DOING BUSINESS WITH‚Ä¶",Positive,0.020085995085995085

I rang and reordered with your team (slighly annoyed because it's an error on your behalf, that should have be sorted by your team but I had to ring and go through everything again). This pushed my delivery and set up for internet back by 5 more days. Now 4 days later, I get a phone call from your team (luckily when I was on a break at work) to say you've cancelled my order because the phone line type was incorrect (i have no email of this or notification alternatively and they have just been ringing for a few days). So I explain, their team member told me which to select if I wasn't sure and filled it in with me on the phone. I request for details of the delivery date, and I can't be told until I have placed the full order again. So after 20 minutes on the call, they the say it's another 10 days after the original is the earliest now. Despite this being another error of theirs (this time their team). Gone to sky, almost cheaper price for the faster internet deal with a booster. And they are coming in 4 days from now rather than 21 days from now (which was the date given by vodafone).

I called them up and the customer rep  had no idea of what she is talking and she first said no we didn't cancel and when i insisted she went to check and came back saying sorry there was a technical glitch , which mean the order is cancelled , i was very unhappy as i got a online discount from quidco when placing that order which now will be cancelled.  The customer care rep had no idea what Quidco is  so it took me 5 min to explain that.  Then she went back and forth to ask their senior question  for everything . I asked her  if i would get a hard check on my credit report , for that she asked me what is hard check and what is credit report. I gave up at that point. Then in the evening i called again to confirm the same , this time i got somebody from local so they understood credit report , and he clearly said ""you are not taking loan from us sir so there will be only soft check on your credit report"" to which i believed . But within 2 days my credit report showed hard check. Now i have 2 hard check for same thing as i had go to another provider because Vodafone was useless .

We we assured the Wi-Fi would be of a superior quality to ensure our home office would function productively on the internet.Not the case, woeful connection, poor streaming and dropping off all the time. While we had technical look at this, the only suggestion was a booster which we installed to improve things only slightly. Finally after putting up with an unreliable Wi-Fi service we relocated our office to the kitchen where the router is, plugged in and the service was excellent apart from the odd drop off, the challenge is with such a busy kitchen, it was not idea for our working environment.Frustrated with this work around we agreed to pay the termination fee for an mis-sold service and one where there was little motivation to fix nor accept any responsibility for the poor service.We now have 30days to find a service provider who will meet customer expectations with a delivery of the service we sign up for.With 2 mobile phone contracts it‚Äôs now likely we will move them also. # Spent over 2 hours today cancelling the‚Ä¶",Positive,0.09188596491228071

1,GB,3,Updated 31 Jan 2024,2 year Broadband Contact,0141b39b-0f5f-41b9-9868-bd724fbf14de,"Taken out a 2 year Broadband Service 500Mbs, changing over from BT 100Mbs service. Took about around half a day for the service to start but the VOIP transfer of the phone number from BT took somewhat longer. That doesn't surprise me and I wouldn't jump to conclusions the extra delay in down to Vodafone. Getting a mobile number transferred between operators  generally goes much more smoothly than transfer of landline numbers. I think it's a good deal at least for the contact period, even factoring in the ubiquitous April over inflation price increases that everyone applies. But whilst my phone number is now recognized the phone still doesn't work as they forgot to include a VOIP phone adapter in the equipment they sent me so they are having to now send through a  BS 6312 (BT) female to RJ11 male adapter separately. The order did include wired phone service  so I'm uncertain whether this omission was a mistake OR if they are just trying to penny pinch by excluding the adapter from the package. It's probably not a great idea to let people try to source their own VOIP adaptor, because there are various types with/without low pass filter and with/without ringing capacitor, and use of the wrong type could then lead to further issues.They did send superfluous adaptors for DSL which I don't need as I'm on Optical Fibre now and don't actually have a copper line any longer. In general I think they could save a bit of cost AND give a better service by matching up the equipment they send with the equipment needed for the order.The telephone  support for this problem was OK, but the link they sent via SMS for video call setup (so they could look at the connections on the back of the router) didn't work so well as the web page on the link  wouldn't let me grant permissions to use my smart phone camera whilst the ongoing phone call icon was still on screen in the foreground. So I had to drop the phone call first in order to grant permissions, and was then me on a video call for where I couldn't hear/see any one on the other end. It did the job though and I left the camera pointing at the back of the router and it became clear later that they had seen what they needed to see when they called me back (though the security questions all needed going through again). I've certainly had a lot worse support from other ISPs and was straight through to someone without waiting when I called them. The router they sent is a Technicolor THG3000. Comparable specs to the Sagecom built BT Smart Hub2 that I was using previously. Slightly more intuitive web user interface, I think. But still no 802.11ax (WiFi 6) or WPA3 security option. Would be nice to see movement from WiFi 5 as some operators are now gearing up to roll out routers with WiFi 7. I was hoping for a WiFi 6 based router, but not too surprised that I didn't get one.Update: The VoIP adapter arrived, but it still didn't have a ringing capacitor within it so everything worked apart from my phone not actually ringing when it's receiving a call. However I know the superfluous DSL filter I was sent will have a 1.0 - 1.8 uF capacitance across the 2 wire voice line side. So I connect the VOIP adapter to the router, the DSL filter to the VOIP adapter, and the phone to the voice side of the DSL filter and BINGO the phone now rings. Nothing like the diagram I was sent but it works. I have the advantage of having worked for GEC Plessey Telecoms in the past so I understood what a non ringing phone means and how to fix that. I fear that Vodafone don't understand any of it anymore because everything is outsourced in such a way that the left hand no longer knows what the right is doing and there is less and less technical expertise actually left in the company itself. # 2 year Broadband Contact",Positive,0.07006556245686682

I've since bought a house and moved into it on the 15/12/23, Vodafone initially told me that the install would happen at the start of January, I forget which date now because it's been so long, they then told me it would be the 18th. A few days before the 18th I get a call telling me the order had been processed wrongly on the system and for that reason OpenReach had rejected it and a new order had to be created, which it was at the time I can't fault whoever it was that called me on that one. So then someone from Vodafone called back a few days later to sort out an install date, which was supposed to be 1st February (bearing in mind as of today 30th january I've been without internet for 46 days, 16 of which I'm ok to discount because Christmas and New Year). Now I get a call today to tell me basically that the install isn't going ahead as ""Openreach are still waiting for an engineer to be assigned to the job so vodafone will call me back on 6th feb with an update and to set my expectations""... having family that used to work for Vodafone and OpenReach, they've both said it's a failure on Vodafone's side to make sure an engineer was actually booked for the date that Vodafone advised. Honestly I'm sick of having to use my mobile as a hotspot as this house has awful signal and it has to sit in my bedroom window to be of any use, and even then a simple youtube video freezes constantly. I know it's such a first world problem, but internet is no longer a luxury it's a necessity to our lives, so I am undeniably stressed by this whole experience and just want my internet installed before I have to start looking somewhere else which honestly I probably should have done the first time this happened. # Broadband (non) install after a move",Negative,-0.023452781786115137

I signed up for their clearly advertised Vodafone broadband package running at 910 Mb (*average) last July, guarantee of minimum 450 Mb, this is all false advertising. My system runs at 350-390 almost all the time as checked by their recommended Speed Test software. The poorly paid near-robots they employ as a cost effective obviously overseas ""customer service"" department quote every time they remotely check the speed as 500 Mb, a script for complaining customers, I even told them this and within a minute they were quoting 800 Mb, for variety I suggested them pretend a higher figure than 500 Mb. I waited for a call back last night from India regarding testing the speeds (3 days average 370 Mb over 9 tests) but they must be busy delivering great service elsewhere. Vodafone are making Billions a year and want to grow and become the customer abusing monopoly serving their share holders and getting larger and more dominant in this field, Governments will need to be greased and influencers paid to achieve this goal. Like many Corporations that now seek to control and financially milk the consumer they care little for the people paying them quite decently for a service they don't provide and in the case of the latest con ""its in the terms and conditions"" they can increase our charges mid contract and take it or leave it, other large corporations are watching and learning. I would guarantee if their ""costs"" go down we won't be getting a reduction in our monthly bills. I will open another case with Modria and get a claim in against them, I am happy to pay for a speed they advertised but won't pay for anything less. Don't bother responding with some lame phone us (did that, you are wasting my time) or Social Media contact (not on it). If Vodafone had dealt with this you would have received a decent review.I was asked and sent Vodafone feed back via email recently and was followed up via a call from some exterior marketing company paid smoozer who simply read back to me my email ,didn't apologise and believed he was responding by putting me through to ""customer services"", brilliant.

You have to pay""- I've had issues with the roaming services for years. Called dozens of times. Issue unresolved, but every time I called they tried to sell me something extra.- The one number connectivity for 3 smart watches is non-functional. Called multiple times, visited the store for technical support - issue unresolved, I was charged for it regardless.- Sales staff misleading and even fraudulent. I call for disconnection, they have marked a number for upgrade and locked me in a contract for another 2 years, despite letting them know of business closure and that one of the number would definitely not be of use anymore. This is blatant theft. - They don't send contractual terms, not do they write clearly what a contract is about: what phone number, what service. All is very vague, with complete lack of transparency.- The notes they released are edited, with minimal information.

It took over a month, 3 different contracts (that Vodafone repeatedly cancelled without warning), endless hours on the phone to people who had no record of the previous calls, until we eventually got our broadband live. Wish I'd never tried to stick with them in the first place. They reassured me it would be easier and quicker to stay with them. Over that terrible changeover period, where they kept cancelling our contracts, in which we had no internet and had to tether off our phones while working from home, we were promised compensation. That never came. Cue more phone calls to a hapless support team. Finally they said they would give a lesser amount of compensation than previously promised. It was to be taken off our future bills. 3 months later, we're still getting billed the same amount. And now we'll have to try a few more hours on the phone to their support team. It. Never.

They strung me along until near December 2023 before cancelling the order because Cityfibre couldn't do the installation.I put in a new order right at the end of the year after confirming they were confident they could fulfill it that time. I got a call 2 days ago to tell me under no uncertain terms that the order had also been cancelled because Cityfibre had categorically informed them, they would NOT be installing Fibre to the building.Less than 24 hours later, yesterday, a team of Cityfibre Installation engineers show up and start installing Fibre in the building.Had a great chat with one of them today, nice bloke.Vodafone simply don't care. Now, they've done 2 hard searches on my credit report and I have absolutely nothing to show for the stress they've caused me and the sheer amount of time they have wasted. I confirmed I could put in another order today, so I do so online, and it failed at the credit check, which I find staggering because I don't have bad credit, and leads me to believe their system rejected me because of 2 previously cancelled orders.Their customer service have awful mic quality and are very difficult to understand, too. It's near impossible to get a telephone number from them as well, I only got one from a live agent via their broken ""TOBi"" chat application on their website.In conclusion, I don't recommend these guys at all.

It seems that someone on their end caused this by mistake, but they refuse to take any action to rectify it immediately. I had to call 4 times to be told that my line is cancelled, as the first 3 customer support agents were just beating around the bush and telling me they see a migration request and that they 'raised requests' that would be looked into within 3-5 days. In the meantime I'm unable to work remotely and use my home internet, nor can I use mobile data as there is no reception where I live. I have no idea how I'm going to get my service back and judging from a past experience with them it will probably take over a month. In which time I will need to move flats as well, so I see far more issues with them in the future. Absolute useless and unreliable, please stay away from them. Avoid them at all costs.Update 29/01:It's been the 7th day that I'm left without broadband today. After being on the phone for 13.5 hours so far with Vodafone, they are still unable to fix my issue. Apparently the issue was caused because of a failed migration from copper to fiber - vodafone messed it up and when copper was stopped my line stopped working as well. I have been told that the issue would take 3-5 working days to be fixed. Then I've been told up to 72 hours. Then apparently the technical aspect was all ok and running but there was no billing information on my account so my line wouldn't operate. I tried multiple times to push for this billing information to be resolved ASAP as I need internet to do my job. It's like talking to a wall - 'sir it's going to take 5 working days'. I'm asking again and again for this to be expedited as it was caused by Vodafone's incompetence, but there is no response to that. Only the script that 'it's going to take 5 working days'. Multiple lies so far in the process (which Vodafone reps call it 'misinformation' but no, it's a lie). First, that the issue would be resolved in 72 hours. Then, that the issue would be resolved by the 29th of January (this has now moved to the 31st of January). For the bot that has replied here saying I need to contact social media, I did contact facebook messenger and didn't get a responce. I'm honestly just waiting to get a big compesation for it and then leave straight away, the absolute worst experience.

I agreed in principle but told them I had to check the contract with my current provider for any penalties for leaving early. I discovered it would cost me ¬£166 to leave so the next day told Vodafone I would wait. A week later my internet was cut off. I contacted my provider and they told me that I was no longer a customer and I was now with Vodafone, and of course they took the money. Vodafone couldn't explain what happened but offered me a free mobile wifi box to keep me going until my Vodafone broadband was set up in a week. A week came and went, no broadband. I went back to Vodafone who told me the order had been cancelled for some reason and it would be rescheduled for the following week and I could keep the mobile wifi, still free of charge, until I was connected the following week. A week later and the same story, no connection and the order had been cancelled again. Order was again rescheduled and once again I was told I could keep the mobile wifi free of charge until I was connected the following week. This time it actually happened and everything worked fine and I returned the mobile wifi box. Despite being told there would be no charge for this it did appear on my first bill. I also believe Vodafone are liable for the ¬£166 it cost to get out of my original contract and I asked them to refund me this money. I was told the best they could do was a ¬£50 refund.

After being with Vodafone on a 24 month contract for my phone and broadband which then moved onto a rolling contract, as I didn‚Äôt renew because they didn‚Äôt want to offer me any decent deals for me to stay. Had a price increase during this and at no point was I offered a better deal. I then received a message from the Vodafone which I initially thought was spam as it sounded as if I had agreed to a new contract without my knowledge. It was in fact for an upgrade to my broadband line from copper connection to fibre optic, but it made it sound as if I had asked for this to be done. After calling them, they said that it was just an intitiative to have lines upgraded by the government and that it was going to happen sooner or later. To which I then said that it was fine, but wasn‚Äôt told that it would tie me into another 24 contract at this point. Something which I hadn‚Äôt even asked for!!! I then called back after the installation of fibre optic, as I was having issues with the phone line when this was done by the engineer, and it was brought to my attention that I was put under a 24 month contract without my knowing. They then said that I was overpaying for my service and told me that I can save ¬£10/month to stay on the same service to which I agreed. As soon as I got off the phone, I was sent a contract that stated it was ¬£14/month more than what was agreed. I then decided that I had enough of Vodafone‚Äôs terrible communication and decided that I didn‚Äôt want to use Vodafone any longer. I was told that I had 30 days to find another provider. 5 days later I am sat here with no internet connection, as my new provider installs in another week. At nonoint was I told I would be disconnected from the service. In fact I was told that it would just switch over automatically. The communication at Vodafone is terrible. They try to lure you into contracts and when you decide to leave they make the process so difficult and leave you with no internet. Shocking service and never will I return to Vodafone again. They say thing and do another. Something needs to be done about these types of providers. They must be doing this to so many vulnerable people. I can‚Äôt stress enough how these guys need investigating for this poor communications and errors that they make. Seems small but causes the customer so much headache. I‚Äôm patient person but I am so angry with this provider.  I work from home and now left without internet for about a week!!! Absolutely no remorse shown either.

I didn't want to deal with the stress over Christmas, so I waited until the 8th January when I couldn't use the Internet at all due to the speed being 2mbps. I spoke to someone who was nice and seemed like they wanted to help. We reset some things which gave me barely enough mbps to do my job, but it kept dropping out. They sent me out a new booster and called me back the next day. On this day we set up the new booster, I commented on how my speeds were better but still dropping out. They wanted to do a speed test using a lan device which I didn't have so we arranged the next day to call again.So day 3. They used a programme to see through my phone, to make sure I was giving them the correct information. Showed a laptop on lan, getting about 15mbps. I pay for 900mbps. The person on the other end kept saying how she wanted to recheck my line from her side 3 times, to make sure she was getting an accurate number, and she confirmed the speed going into my house was roughly 15mbps... But it was fluctuating. So she said citi fibre would need to come out. I booked three slots and was told they could come out any of these times, but she'd ask them to can me first. The appointment times were 8am to 6pm on the 16th and 2pm to 6pm on the 17th So from 8am on the 16th Jan I was stuck to my phone. I work from home and everytime I thought I had a car or van, I went to check. No one came to the house, and no one called. I think these companies forget that I can literally screenshot my call list to show that no one rang me.So I took the weekend off from this stress and today raised a complaint, as I didn't want to have to go through the same 3 day process as before. I receive a text message saying I would get a call between 4 and 6pm tonight.The person who rang me might have been a complaint manager but it was hard to keep track as they spoke so quickly. I'd ask a question about why citi fibre didn't come out to the appointment and get a 3 minute response to say they did come out and checked the line and they did call me. Again, I can screenshot my call list and show the only call I received was after 6pm, and I answered it.They wanted to know how much compensation I wanted and I kept trying to explain I wanted the % of days since I first reported the issue on the 8th. I then got a lecture (I received this lecture about 6 times, I kid you not) that I had only reported an issue in October that was put as resolved and the report on the 8th Jan which had been marked as resolved because I didn't answer my phone when contacted. At some point I asked them to please stop shouting at me and of course they said they weren't shouting at me and calls were recorded, however as soon as I asked them to stop shouting, they then stopped shouting. A ticket was raised about someone coming out but they didn't explain exactly what was happening. Finally managed to get them to tell me at the end that someone will contact you within the next 24-48 hours and book a time for a technician to come out again (surely if they did in fact come out last time, they wouldn't be doing this again as there is no fault?). Then they went on another lecture about how Vodafone gave me the ¬£17.03 I asked for because they're not about making money but caring about people. If that were true they wouldn't have shouted at me and kept telling me that I was at fault because I didn't answer my phone that never rang. So there is no time frame for when they're going to call me. So they could call when I'm driving and if I don't answer they'll close the ticket as resolved. I'll have to take my phone to the bathroom then and they can hear me using the loo or in the middle of a shower.. Honestly why can't they give me the working hours so I'd know when to accept the call?There were technical issues throughout this call. I was put back on hold by accident. The call ""disconnected"" and they had to ring me back. I received a text message stating they'd call me today between 4 and 6 pm, but the multi text messages they sent me with the reference number did not come through, but of course this wasn't there issue. It was clearly issues with my phones connection (which I don't have currently). Why is it that these companies refuse to take any responsibility. I did not answer the phone when called (there was no call). The time I called was put as resolved yet I'm still reporting an issue. They couldn't agree to compensation unless I calculated the exact amount I pay per day, because that would have been too difficult for them to do? Their text service is fine so it's my phones connection that's the issue, without asking me if there was one. They also kept stating that everytime they checked my line it was fine, but I know this is not the case.

Having to call them every single month to rectify something on my bill. Being autistic I use the web chat service as phone calls are extremely hard for me, once the staff know that they talk to me like I‚Äôm stupid and make really ableist remarks. I‚Äôve never been on the web chat for less than 30 minutes and that‚Äôs not including any waiting time usually it‚Äôs a few hours!! they also seem hell bent on asking if your details are upto date and if you say ‚Äòall my details are upto date‚Äô they don‚Äôt believe you and waste more time confirming details for no reason. Today I was on the webchat for over an hour nearly 2 because I couldn‚Äôt get signal on my phone, after speaking to 2 advisors (who made me do the same things) one of which insisted I changed my settings to something that would impact my battery (and when I refused lied to me saying that it wouldn‚Äôt even though my phone was even telling me so) a manager appeared and fixed the problem in 5 minutes.I had a direct debit set up briefly but after being sent a text saying ‚ÄòI need to pay my bill now or they will cut me off‚Äô so I went on the webchat just to be told I had to pay the bill even though there was a direct debit in place. I paid it and then a few days later the direct debit came out! When I tried to get my money back they said they would discount it from my next bill!?! Then I had to threaten to take it further while they lied to me saying they don‚Äôt have the ability to do refunds. I did eventually get my money back, eventually!They also message you about paying your bill before the bills even due and now due to them changing their contracts into 2 bills instead of 1. if you pay the device bill early then it‚Äôs classed as a contribution not a bill payment so you need to pay twice or they threaten to cut you off! And no they won‚Äôt refund or let you move anything around. They constantly assure you that your problems with them won‚Äôt be repeated whilst simultaneously constantly repeating the problems.There‚Äôs more and more and moreAll the staff are either not getting the correct training or just do not care about helping you fix problems and don‚Äôt have any care for inclusivity for those with disabilities.

I spent a considerable amount of time on phone other day, but it seems there isn't any way I can get the money to them, so looks like I will be running up charges through no fault of my own. I tried to transfer it via my bank, but as my account is closed, it didn't recognise my account so bank said it couldn't send my money. I tried paying Vodafone on their own line thing, same thing happened. Phoned customer care, automated line won't accept it either, so I was told I have to pay by cheque ( I have no cheque book, neither does anyone I know) or pay it at the local shop. The problem there being I am disabled with no car and getting to town is expensive and not simple. Plus it has to be said I think it unlikely that the people at the shop would accept the payment either .Has I am struggling with an auto immune disease which is made worse with stress, as well as a myriad of other health issues including remission from cancer, and also that phone companies have made my life a total misery since moving house, I am a loss as to what to do about paying Vodafone a precious 14 pounds which is obviously easily more important than my health.And it's no good them telling me to contact their social media team as I'm not on social media and do not understand tech.UpdateRe answer from Vodafone from my review before. I have rung the customer service and it's difficult because everything is saying they don't recognise my number as having an account with Vodafone. Which is strange because how then did they manage to text my number asking for 14 pounds?? I don't even know what the 14 pounds is for, as I left during the 14 day cooling off period. Still the agent wanted a pin that I do not have. I told her my situation and all the cruelty and time wasting I've had from mobile phone companies since I moved house, and the answer to my review on trust pilot. Then she got angry and shouted at me that she couldn't take my money without the pin and I'd have to pay it at the shop.I have already explained the difficulty and expense if have getting to the shop.I have now placed this matter with age UK who will be ringing you early next week. I am also in the process of sending information on how ridiculous this has unfolded, and unreasonable treatment of a vulnerable person by three major providers to my local MP, who particularly dislikes this kind of practice by big companies and their staff.I've tried several times to pay this money and I haven't been able to, I don't even know what it's for. So now I suppose you will add on hundreds of pounds in charges and send me threatening messages.21st century UK.

I had the Z fold 3 which is in warranty and their external company that repair are trying to charge ¬£600+ for the screen splitting which is after researching is a common theme and telling me its not protected as its screen issue and because of scratches from my keys on the frame which is purely cosmetic and impact damage which wasn't there when I handed the phone over to the Vodafone employee to send off. How can you say you'll not cover it under warranty because of those reasons but you'll repair the screen which is covered by the warranty for ¬£600 ü§î I also am 16 days into a new contract with the S23 Ultra as I thought Vodafone were decent which I'm regretting now. My broadband contract with Vodafone is ending in August and will definitely not be renewing. So disappointing after so many years. Total care warranty is a joke.

I'm a systems and networks engineer by trade and despite happily being given the PPPoE Username and Password, I kept getting rejected by their system when trying to establish a connection. I'm fully aware of the VLAN's for different network providers and played about with a few settings as well as trying different combinations due to other user experiences however still did not work. Called Vodaphone a total of 4 times to try and get it resolved and they only help they were prepared to give is to provide the Username and Password.In the end I decided to cancel within 24 hours as the Customer Service was abysmal! I did try using the router purely as a modem for my existing equipment (against my preference as I'd prefer to have just one device) but the UI for the router is so unbelievably un-user friendly it is ridiculous. For example there is limited functionality and when you try and change the LAN IP settings, you go to enter an IP address and after the 1st Octet it automatically skips to the 3rd completely missing out the 2nd so after each octet you have to use the mouse to go to the next one. This is such a basic function that it should go from one to the next without skipping but clearly the firmware is lacking in common sense.So as I said previously after no help from 1st line support and their refusal from 2nd line support to investigate, I have decided to cancel the service within 24 hours as it tells me all I need to know about Vodaphone's Broadband as a provider. # BROADBAND - STAY AWAY IF YOU HAVE A 3RD PARTY ROUTER!!!",Positive,0.03338509316770188

I asked for a similar package to the one I had which was for 24 months. What she didn't explain was that I would be paying an extra ¬£6 per month for 36 months to purchase the phone This was on top of my billing for texts etc. Now my two years is up I wanted to renew my phone as the one which she advised me to get was useless. But I was stuck in a 24 month contract. Phoning Vodafone is an experience. Kept putting me on hold to get advice about the extra ¬£6 per month for 36 months. He was so unhelpful and in the end I've had to pay ¬£96 up front to purchase the useless phone and to get out of the contract. I told him that I couldn't afford it and would have to cut back on my outgoings to cover the cost. He didn't care. I'm 79 years old but not stupid. The lady in the Vodafone shop should have had more training as should the chat and phone services for Vodafone which were useless. I'm so stressed by this incident. I've been with Vodafone for a great many years and would never use them again They are heartless. Unfortunately I didn't read the small print but took the lady's word for the contract.

1,GB,1,19-Jan-24,Stay away from this company,e4836df2-bded-4b34-b735-2119dec8bd43,I had a phone contract with devise with Vodafone back in 2020 and when the device cost was paid they continue to take the money and tell you this is your responsibility to call when the device has finished being paid for. So I called to cancel and I was told you need a pac code. I feel I made it more than clear I want the contract cancelled and I cancelled my direct debit. to then receive a bill with no other contact to say they will pass this onto a dept collection agent for ¬£72.10 So again I called and I was told they are sorry but they did not cancel the contract and said this would now take 24 hours to cancel and I will need to call back to process the credit. I call back again and have to go through the process again and get passed from one agent to the next this has now taken hours. My experience is Vodaphone are bullies who will keep taking you money even when the cost of the device has been paid. They have no intension of sorting out the issue and expect people to be experts on what pac numbers are. This is simple I want to cancel why does a pac number being given to another provide have to be the way to cancel. At the point of calling I'm out of contract. Do as I ask and cancel the sim simple. Just to recap Vodaphone will charge you for something you have already paid for. # Stay away from this company,Positive,0.02386363636363636

Set up was great and can‚Äôt fault CityFibre at all, respectful, quick, clean installation and the supply is all good, I have no disappointment with regards to any of this. However when taking out the contract online I was informed that I do not need to do anything with regards to cancellation of my current provider, BT, and that Vodafone will inform them directly. After all was set up I contacted BT to inform them I would be cancelling my DD payments and was told they they were not informed. After a lengthy call to Vodafone I now have to take myself to one of their shop once I have proof of last payment to BT and the email showing where it says I didn‚Äôt need to do anything (this of course being an automatically generated email and likely to be what they send out all the time) and once showing them this they will refund me what I have paid to BT due to Vodafone not cancelling on my behalf. Being self employed and working six days a week I probably won‚Äôt have time to do this so I‚Äôm very disappointed by this situation.

I was assured the fibre would be working within 48 hours. The copper broadband connection was turned off after 48 hours however the fibre broadband still was not working, leaving me without a broadband connection. I spoke to Vodafone again and they assured me they had now fixed the issue and it would be working within 24 hours. 24 hours later I still didn‚Äôt have broadband connection, I spoke to somebody else via a raised complaint, they followed up by email to say that it would be fixed with it 24-48 hours. After that time it still was not working. I phoned the fault line with the fault reference number I had been sent on email and it did not recognise the fault number. I eventually spoke to somebody, who passed me on to somebody else, who directed me through a hard reset. They said it would be up and running within max 1 hour but more likely 10 mins. No surprises, it‚Äôs still not working. When trying to arrange an engineer, the guy on the phone said there was a fault in the appointment booking system and he would have to do it manually. So I still have no broadband connection and by the time the engineer comes back out it will have been 10 days without an internet connection.The ‚Äòcompensation‚Äô offered is pitiful.

I ordered broadband for my office and home. they have cancelled my order three times and can give no reason. I am now in a position where I'm out of contract with BT and paying over the odds in my office and at home I have had no broadband for three weeks.

I wanted to get a cheaper deal as I had not been using all the allowances. The assistant was really helpful in finding a cheaper contract with Talkmobile at ¬£12.95 per month (reduced from ¬£28.50).A couple of hours later someone from Vodafone called (as I had requested a PAC) to talk about a Vodafone retention deal for ¬£8 per month but, as I had already switched, she could not actually offer me that deal. I expressed my disappointment that could not have been offered in the shop earlier. She said that the deal would not have been available to the shop assistant at that time. I said that I was not very impressed that the customer service was not very ""joined up"" across all of the Vodafone teams and that I felt very let down having thought I had got the best deal possible only to discover that a better deal could have been on the table for me. Obviously, I accept that neither the sales assistant or the retention team person were individually at fault here and no deception was meant BUT I do feel very disappointed that a Vodafone Shop did not have all the right available deals for me to choose from at the initial point of contact and sale!Not brilliant customer service in my opinion. # CHANGING CONTRACT",Positive,0.07593378843378842

I have had my network not work for up to a month several times over the past year - Vodafone never ever let me know there would be disruptions - I had to call in every time and they would say oh theirs issues and the engineers are working on it, it‚Äôs due to end this date xxxxxx please call back then to get a refund applied. It wasn‚Äôt until the most recent call in November an agent told me they would sign me up for automatic service updates. I then called for the refund I was due to receive in November, in jan, as getting through to them is a nightmare. They made me wait 20 minutes on hold to say there‚Äôs currently service issues they are working on which won‚Äôt be completed until March (I‚Äôm leaving them in feb) and ‚Äúas per their policy‚Äù they can‚Äôt refund me until the work has been completed as it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to me. So just to clarify their policy is you can only ask for a refund after they have completed the work, so you are compensated in full but it‚Äôs your duty to call once the work has been completed - which they most likely will not notify you for. If you don‚Äôt call you‚Äôre not automatically refunded, unless you bring it to their attention despite them not proving the service you are paying for. When you do call back to have this applied, despite several agents stating they have left notes on your account, you spend up to an hour of your time describing the situation and being passed from department to department explaining why you‚Äôre due the refund for them to tell you to CALL BACK WHEN YOUR BILL IS DUE to take it off then. I absolutely detest this network, everyone I know on the network detests it also. Their policies and customer service is despicable, and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre cheaper than EE (who btw i never ever had issues with). Please if you take any advice ever, let it be to avoid this network like the plague. They do not deserve to be providing services as I‚Äôm sure many people are getting scammed.

But ok - first bill. Second bill ¬£20. My first contact by the phone - three operators and 3h lost during conversation. Nobody know about ¬£17. But one lady told me information. You have not direct debit and will fee ¬£5. ME????????? DURING SIGNHT CONTRACT NOBODY TOLD ME ABOUT IT. ONE YEAR I PAID AND INFORMATION ABOUT ACCOUNT WAS IN SYSTEM.Next day again called to me Vodafone and try explained me information ¬£20 bill but I ask about ¬£17 paid first time ?????????Ok Vodafone operator told me .... ok we give you ¬£20 refund of this ¬£17. Me: Ok it is fine form me. Next bill ¬£10 + ¬£ 5 fee no direct debit. ???I call again why ¬£5 Fee ??? finally they has my account detail but was not activated this direct debit. But ¬£5 gone. I called again why ¬£5 fee because it is on bill from last month and was refund in this ¬£20. ¬£20 refund of the ¬£17 not ¬£5??? Finally this ¬£5 was not refund - it is lost. I lost on the conversation about 6-7h (all).I waiting to finish my contract with the Vodafone. Maybe problem is with the people of the info line but people make the company.

The way they treat their customers is so poor. Causing so much inconvenience and wasting so much time. I have been on a customer support chat for 2h 15 min. For something as basic as wifi coverage which Vodafone can't provide to their customers. So ridiculous. Also Shubham, Mohit and Anushree have provided disgusting and rude customer service, completely useless. They kept repeating the same things and did not solved the issue. Do not buy any plans with Vodafone. They have become too big to appreciate their customers business apparently. There are other broadband providers out there they still respect their customers paying the bills to the business. If any issues with Vodafone broadband the customer service is very inefficient via Tobi chat as well as being passed from one department to the other and wasting so much time on the chat box. Rather than efficiently solving the issues in a timely fashion. Also, there are unique instances like mine where there is a need for a tech expert to physically come and have a look at the issue rather than me chatting for hours with very poor quality Vodafone employees that do not have the basis to understand the problems.

Fine when you're buying. Awful at creating & resolving issues. Never again.Vodafone's replies have been typically more corporate platitudes and bland spaghetti word salads that mean nothing in the real world - if they acted or actually understood or were congruent with their messages I would still be a customer and had days of my life restored.Update - having wasted two hour and Vodafone confirming in writing (I have copies) that this insane 1p bill will be sorted I am still being pursued for the ""oustanding bill"" of 1p.Before you sign-up with their amazing sales team read their canned bot customer service answers here - all platitudes and meaningless corporate-speak - no care no action.PS my partner was on a Vodafone sim only cancelled end of contract because of the price then was offered a deal half the cost with twice the data - where from Vodafone!!! So much for valuing customer loyalty.They carry on charging for the phone after the phone has been fully paid for, only offering high, contracted term sim only prices that are worse than offers to new customers.

Was told that my order will be delivered on Tuesday next week and that I will receive a PIN code to my email address as DPD won‚Äôt release my order without it. All seems fine I thought until DPD try to deliver the to me the next day but I haven‚Äôt received a PIN to my phone number or email address. Turns out that for some reason known only to Vodafone, they have given DPD a long since cancelled phone number that I once had with them many years ago rather than my main contact number that I‚Äôve had with them now for years, the one that they call me & text me on fairly frequently? Common sense seems to be completely lost here. Then I reach out to them on X / twitter, they ask me to explain the problem (I‚Äôve already done this on the phone to customer services). Which I do again, I tell them the details of my issue on X. They then have the absolute stupidity to say to me ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sorry that you feel like this‚Äù (yes my friend, I feel like this because I‚Äôve already taken time to explain my complaint to you and you‚Äôre now asking me to write to you to explain the whole thing again) ask me to contact them via email / facebook messenger to explain my complaint all over again.  I mean, this company has absolutely no self awareness whatsoever.  They do not even reach the minimum expected level of customer service in the marketplace, and are blissfully ignorant & unaware of what that minimum looks like, let alone what GOOD SERVICE looks like. # Truly shocking & terrible service from Vodafone",Negative,-0.10359848484848486

I've been a customer for several years and was generally satisfied with the WiFi connection I had until I decided to upgrade to full fiber in August 2022. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a big mistake and a major disappointment.Initially, my contract was ¬£24.00 a month for a maximum 67mb connection, which worked fine. However, in August 2022, Vodafone offered me full fiber 900mb for ¬£30.00 a month, which seemed like a great deal for the increased speed and reasonable price. However, after the upgrade, I started experiencing frequent connectivity issues.I've contacted Vodafone customer services multiple times in an attempt to resolve these issues, but unfortunately, they have been unable to fix the problem. They have sent me three boosters, but these have provided no improvement whatsoever.As someone who works from home, this situation has greatly affected my work. I'm unable to maintain a stable connection during video meetings on platforms like WhatsApp and Skype, and even my TV connection keeps cutting off.Even after speaking with a Vodafone broadband expert in January 2024 who assured me that the issue would be resolved, nothing has changed. This has been a shocking and frustrating experience. I will never choose or recommend Vodafone to anyone else. I would like to cancel my account at the earliest possible please.Following my complaint, Vodafone reached out to discuss the issue. However, despite the clear evidence that the problem lies with their network, they are still insisting on charging a cancellation fee. This is completely unreasonable. # Vodafone broadband",Negative,-0.007118055555555538

I have been misled and manipulated. I am happy to have checked now but now I don't want to keep these 2 years contracts.I need to check if I can end that contract because I don't want to use Vodafone anymore.Check before you get a contract with them, they charge many things outside the contract and if you need to pay to go abroad, Vodafone is definitively not  a company to use, most of the others don't charge a daily fee.I hope my mistake will save the hassle to other customers. Stay away from Vodafone, they have no good deal and add extra charges to the bill. # 1 day european roaming pass: ¬£2.25",Positive,0.05500000000000002

4,GB,1,Updated 12 Jan 2024,Don't buy phones and plans from Vodafone!,318ae47a-61a7-4b02-ab90-b4f4b93a5d3b,"I bought a phone from them over Black Friday, built my data plan on my phone, gave my old phone for trade in. In no part of the buying process I was informed or consented that they would give me a new card and new number, not put the plan on my actually existing number. Again, during no point of this purchase I was informed that I would have to use a new number, and that they wouldn't cancel the payments for the other line so my old number would cost me another ¬£32 monthly (I was out of plan and which is why I wanted to drop it and have a new plan), on top of the new sim ¬£16 + the actual phone cost. So now, I am paying ¬£48 alone on only the data, another ¬£26 for the device, why the hell am I paying ¬£74 to you, and this is my discounted price after I traded in my old phone?! Why wouldn't you inform me that you wouldn't simply put the new plan on my existing number? Or inform me that I would be charged for both lines? Why would you give me a new number that I didn't ask for and paid for the past 2 months? Why would your customer assistants inform me that this would change this month and I wouldn't be charged and there would be a refund on my account for the December but I am still informed that I need to pay ¬£74? I went to Vodafone shop in Shepherds Bush to ask about the extra SIM card Vodafone has sent me and they checked my account and said Vodafone just sends them away to make sure customers have micro sims available for their new devices, nothing to worry about and everything‚Äôs fine. No mention of 2 different numbers, accounts, nothing. I wonder for how many of your customers you're pulling this stuff, how many people pay you for stuff they didn't ask for and aren't aware of! I should have been paying ¬£16 for my new plan on my EXISTING number, and ¬£26 for my device, so ¬£42 a month, not the ¬£74 I have been paying for the past 2 months! You are taking my phone for trade in for ¬£5 a month, instead charge me ¬£32 more!!!!!!!! Why would I want to change my number when I‚Äôm trying to add a new airtime plan to my number, while I already have an existing number with you for over 5 years? What makes you think we should add a new number for them, instead of actually putting an airtime plan to the existing phone number? Throughout the process on Vodafone app, in nowhere, not while I was picking for a phone, nor when I was picking an airtime plan, I was asked if I was aware that the new Airtime plan would be on a NEW NUMBER. I was not made aware. When I went to your shop, I was told not to worry, it was my own number and just a spare card, when I called your customer service, I was told they were sorry and they would fix it. This is disgusting. I should've just gone to Apple instead of being scammed for ¬£32 every month by you! Disgusting. I have just talked on Facebook customer care and was informed I have to cancel my service? I wasn‚Äôt informed about anything. Your employee SACHIN was not helpful at all, told me because I signed it, I was responsible. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE WHEN YOU DECIDE TO PUT THE AIRTIME PLAN ON A NEW NUMBER WHEN AN EXISTING CUSTOMER WITH AN EXISTING NUMBER MAKES A PURCHASE. It makes absolutely zero sense that you would give your customers a new number without warning them about it multiple times with big fonts that the airtime is not going to be on their EXISTING NUMBER. THAT YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP CHARGING BE THEM ON THE EXISTING NUMBER, ON TOP OF THE NEW NUMBER. I will be making legal complaints to Trading standards and I‚Äôm already in contact with citizens advice over this.

I will now have to waste another day of my time trying to get hold of them to sort this out.Update: Lovely template reply shows that my review clearly wasn't actually read by Vodafone.

7,GB,1,11-Jan-24,Their staff are just useless,97b82606-8c12-4228-9b0d-02ba82d7445e,"I‚Äôm a business customer with a few mobile lines in Nuneaton have been with Vodafone for a just over a year. We moved from EE as they were so expensive, and although Vodafone are cheaper, their coverage is poor. We are based in CV10 and quite often we get a 3G or E bar and neither load the internet.I need to get an iPhone 15 pro max for my business so I was going to upgrade early with Vodafone and pay an extra ¬£270 to do the early upgrade, but when I thought about it, I really didn‚Äôt want to be tied to them for another two years with bad signal.On Monday the 8th Jan I called to speak to them  about it. The call handler said she‚Äôd pass it to the tech team who would call me back in 10 mins, I didn‚Äôt receive any call backs.On Tuesday 9th Jan I called and re explained my issue. This man was a-bit more helpful and said he understood my issue and would look to see how we could improve signal and he also offered to turn on my 5G. I questioned why it hadn‚Äôt been connected before, but then he checked and said there is no 5G in or around Nuneaton. He also admitted once 3G is turn off I really would have issues so said he‚Äôd investigate and call me back at 5pm.I was at work and my phone was on silence be he called me back at 1pm, 2.30pm and 4pm. He left voicemails each time to confirm the signal won‚Äôt improve and I can cancel with no exit fee. He didn‚Äôt call me at 5pm though unfortunately so I called back on Wednesday the 9th to cancel the contract.This is where the issues really began. The person on the 9th hadn‚Äôt left any notes on my account and absolutely no one else can do anything or use any common sence (and apparently they can‚Äôt speak to the person I spoke to on the 9th to confirm anything).I was on the phone for an hour and a half on the 10th to a woman. Initially she was looking into it, then she couldn‚Äôt as she had no authority to do anything anyway, then she was passing it to the tech team, then to a manager to request them to listen to the call between myself and the person on the 9th.I explained there was no point listening to that call, they need to listen to the calls he made to my voicemail, but she couldn‚Äôt comprehend that they would have those calls recorded too and she kept saying for data protection they wouldn‚Äôt be able to access those (they‚Äôre outgoing calls, what difference does it make if I‚Äôve answered the phone or he‚Äôs left me a voicemail)?I offered to save the recoding and email them over but she wouldn‚Äôt allow that either. The manager refused to speak to me and I ended up loosing my ***.Today, Thursday the 11th, Vodafone just called (fantastic)! The person on the phone said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling to see if your issue has been resolved‚Äù? I asked if he‚Äôd resolved it and he said he hadn‚Äôt even read the notes and didn‚Äôt even know what my issue was‚Ä¶so that was another 15 min call completely wasting my time. He couldn‚Äôt even explain why he was calling me. After doing a little bit of research he said ‚Äúa manager is listening to the call and will get back to you in 24hrs‚Äù‚Ä¶which is what I already knew..so why was he calling? If the call centre was 4500 miles closer I‚Äôd have gone there and banged on the door until they dealt with my issue. I‚Äôm so annoyed! I always expect business customers to have a slightly better experience than the public, so I dread to think how they treat the public.I‚Äôm still no further forward. I‚Äôve explained to them on every single call that I NEED a new IPhone 15 by Saturday as we‚Äôre using it for promo work for my business so I need them to let me leave the contract based on poor signal.The woman yesterday said they‚Äôve had loads of mast issues and also said that if I had proof someone told me I could cancel I can, yet they won‚Äôt listen to my voicemails.If there were no signal issues I‚Äôd have simply upgraded. # Their staff are just useless",Negative,-0.03787451583504216

After months of City Fibre turning up and trying to install the line, they are not able to attach a line to a chimney, there was no other fixing point on that would allow line to be at the minimum required height across my neighbours garden/and or the road outside. After all this hassle, I instructed them to cancel the Fibre upgrade and leave me alone. October, my contract came to an end. I placed an order with BT to take over my line. Vodaphone text me acknowledgement on 14th November confirming my line would be taken over and I would be disconnected from 13th December. On the 17th November I received a text message advising that they were going to UPGRADE ME on 6th December!!!! Trying to cancel this upgrade was a bloody nightmare. Automated text messages etc DID NOT WORK. ONLY after I tried twice, was my messaged passed to a HUMAN, and on 22nd November they acknowledged that I was NOT upgrading to full fibre with City Fibre and have cancelled that order. On the 13th December BT did not take over the line (they needed a cherry picker to reach the chimney) and recommended I contact Vodaphone to ask they do not terminate my service until take over complete (I'm a home worker). I called Vodaphone and was advised it was TOO late. They start the process, within the 48hrs in the lead up, and as a result my service would be terminated that day. FINE! Anything to be rid of Vodaphone! I decided to buy a bolt on, for extra data on my phone to hot/spot work from home. SURPRISE SURPRISE, my internet was still working the following week! So I called Vodaphone who advised because BT hadn't taken the line over yet, it was still working, and I would need to pay that months bill. Paid it. BT Installed my line 2nd January! Horay! Bill received from VODAPHONE! LINE NOT CANCELLED! They tried to tell me, because BT didn't take the line on the 13th December, I HAD TO DO A MANUAL CANCELLATION! AND REPLACE THE TERMINATION ORDER! And I would have to pay charges for the line up to today! 11th January! I am fuming! Customer service is shocking. No one is listening, and only after 1hr30 mins, going round and round in circles, the only thing I THINK has happened, is the line has been cancelled. I'm being told billing cannot sort the issues until the termination is complete, which takes 2 working days. SO are calling me back Tuesday. The service has been disgusting, and shocking!

46,GB,1,11-Jan-24,2 Years and a Nightmare story to carry out a basic upgrade,af1cfc92-3455-46d6-98f1-443ec9711be1,"Dear Vodafone Complaints Manager,I am writing to you to raise an issue about: Home BroadbandThe issue that I have experienced was: 1) On the 11th December 2023: I received numerous suspicious emails regarding my new order / upgrading.  Knowing that I had not placed any orders with vodafone, I spoke on live chat to confirm if any fraud had arisen on my account.  The order stating: Your plan: Migration Only Full Fibre - 80Order number: Order date: 11/Dec/2023 16:51:01After speaking with a live chat advisor, he told me that this is simply that all broadband providers are switching to full fibre lines and even if I changed provider they would be contacting me to do this.  So I allowed vodafone to keep this going and was stated a engineer would be out on 11th January 2024 at 1pm - 6pm.2) On the 31st December 2024: I called up Vodafone to hand in my 30 days notice as I was told this was needed to ensure not termination fees etc would be applied and I would be able to leave without any problems on the 18th January 2024, due to finding a better deal elsewhere.3) On the 2nd January 2024:  I saw via my online Vodafone account I had an upgrade line which was offering Full fibre 200 for ¬£27 per month.  I decided to take out this offer via my account and this order was placed.  On the 8th January , i then got an email from Vodafone stating they were unable to process my order and a number to call to get in touch to discuss this issues. I called the number attached and spoke with a Tainen Jai, who confirmed the order was cancelled but was not sure why.  He told me that he would remove this order and place a new order for me and ensured I had the same deal offered to me.  Unfortunately Tainen Jai must of received some distressing news about his wife and told me he needed to rush through the terms and conditions and final parts as he needed to leave, which i understood  but also was worried everything had be done correctly.  After this phone call I received all my confirmation and everything seemed to be in correct order.4) Today (11th Jan 2024) aka Engineer Visit day to install Fibre lines: I received an email again stating, that they had cancelled the first broadband order (from the 2nd January) and that the engineer visit was also cancelled.  Initially this seemed correct as i knew my first upgrade order, was over written by Tainen Jai's order, but i was unsure whether this meant if the engineer visit for today (11th Jan 2024) to install purely the fibre lines was still going ahead.  So i called to up to make sure if this was still going ahead as I did not want to be waiting in the house for nothing.  After being on the phone for an hour, it now turns out that my new 2nd order (via Tainen Jai) was also cancelled - despite it showing 'in process' on the the tracking page.  I was then told that I would now have to place a 3rd order for it to go through.  Speaking with the upgrade team they also stated they could no longer offer me the upgrade plan of ¬£27 per month but I had to pay ¬£30 and then to add insult to injury they stated my landline number was disconnected and I would have to have a brand new number instead.  And that I need to call back on Wednesday 17th January to see if I can retain my old landline number or not. # 2 Years and a Nightmare story to carry out a basic upgrade",Positive,0.13358225108225108

You can imagine our frustration when the actual speed was as low as 2Mbps. Sometimes the connection is so poor that we lose it altogether. After a 5-week nightmare trying to engage with their ‚Äúsupport‚Äù, they finally admitted that their product is not fit for service. However they made it clear that this was our fault. Our property is not suited to their package. We should have been aware of this when we signed up.It gets worse. They also told us that this is a common problem with their package. They know that this is an issue, yet they continue to advertise their package without a health warning. Be aware that ‚Äúup to 910Mbps‚Äù means anything from zero onwards. They knew that there was an issue with this package, but they subjected us to more than 4 hours of their gruelling ‚Äúsupport‚Äù. The help centre is located overseas so the phone connection is appalling and it barely possible to make out what the ‚Äúhelper‚Äù is saying. They asked us, in barely comprehensible jargon, to carry out tests with equipment we didn‚Äôt have to verify what we had already told them. They assured that their system told them that everything up to the router was fine. Anything beyond that was our problem. The futility of these wasted hours defies description.

Customer services insisted that an engineer (from Openreach) would need visit my property for the activation to be successful.The 11th of December comes around, however an engineer never came in the 5 hour time slot they advised! However I still got a message all work was complete and my system was working. It wasn‚Äôt!Long story short, after a week of investigation it was found the engineer had gone to the wrong property and installed my broadband at a random (incorrectly provided) address. The address was completely different to mine. It was checked by Vodafone and they confirmed the address I provided was recorded correctly in the system. Very strange.Due to the time of the month, a week before Christmas, Vodafone were unable to arrange or approve an engineer to visit to install my actual broadband until the 8th of January. Nearly one month after my first activation date!!After a long month of using mobile data the 8th of January finally approached.On the 7th of January, I received an automated text message from Openreach reminding me they will be coming to my property only to reference the incorrect address, again!! After reaching out to customer services they now inform me I will have to wait till January 22nd for my broadband to be installed, WITHOUT the need of an engineers visit like I first thought! On all occasions where Openreach were at ‚Äòmy property‚Äô they were at the incorrect address. An absolute joke! Every time Vodafone spoke to me on the phone they said they would make sure the issue would be fixed and look to move the activation date forward as a priority. This has never happened!Hopefully the broadband will be installed and working on the 22nd and I will receive compensation for all the hassle and incomplete service. First time using Vodafone, so far I would not recommend to anyone. To make the service better, it would help if Vodafone could provide/reference the correct address to Openreach. # 1 month on, still no broadband.",Positive,0.07173913043478261

27,GB,1,Updated 10 Jan 2024,Inept. Incompetent. Utterly disrespectful,07a84d17-3fce-478c-8abb-167280abce59,"I paid over ¬£1000 for a new phone out of necessity (not choice) on Saturday. I was told it would connect on Tuesday. It still hasn't connected. I went through all the usual steps. Went online to get help. TOBi was as much use a chocolate teapot - kept sending verification codes to my disconnected number. Then started coming up with server errors. After 30 MINUTES I finally get connected to a person, who is speaking to so many complainants that it takes 5 MINUTES to answer every text (having been warned to send random texts every 2-3 minutes to keep us connected!?!) Only when I say cancel the order do I get some dedicated attention but 16 minutes in (total 46 MINUTES) and they have still done nothing to even find out what the problem is. Instead just messaging excuses. 22 MINUTES in (total 52 MINUTES) they tell me 'I have connect with my manager please allow me to share your issue' except they haven't even asked me what the issue is!?! ONE MINUTE LATER and I get a message 'We have not heard from you in quite some time. Seems like we have lost connection. I'll give it a minute more before I end this chat session.' Incredible! So they can have you sat waiting for 5 minutes for a reply but you get 1 minute!?!After a total of 61 MINUTES I get passed to a Resolution Manager. He STILL doesn't ask what the problem is though tells me 'I am aware of the situation' - except none of them are because they just don't ask me! After 64 MINUTES I finally get asked a first question. Having explained that I have carried over my number and SIM from my old Tesco Mobile Contract, I am then asked to confirm if I have put the new SIM in the new device; despite having clearly explained there is no New SIM but only the unlocked one. Having explained that it was unlocked with a PAC Code in the store. I am assured that I will not be charged for the connection downtime, but of course, the 1 HOUR and 15 MINUTES to still not get a resolution means I have lost more than 2 months rental equivalent in earnings. After 80 MINUTES I am finally told it is not possible to transfer the SIM over - I should have had a new one given to me and it will take 1-3 business days to send one. Incredibly, without going through 5 layers of security, they already have my address. Amazing that necessity is the mother of efficiency... I was told then that once my first bill is generated I can spend another 90 minutes trying to speak to someone to discuss compensation... Despite the fact that I am on the max, all in, super-duper plan which they know how much the bill will be. I refuse. I tell them to discuss it now. They insist they must order the SIM before discussing compensation. I foolishly agree and am offered a ¬£10 Morrisons voucher in compensation. It is now 1 HOUR and 42 MINUTES I have spent trying to solve a 30 second problem...TIME is the most precious commodity we have as human beings. No amount of wealth or ingenuity can buy back WASTED TIME.In the 102 MINUTES I spent trying to sort out a pretty simple problem, 9053 peoples lives have ended... If nothing else, these inept, incompetent companies must respect and pay for peoples time; after all, we pay them for their time...UPDATE: Vodafone now want me to waste EVEN MORE TIME by recycling all of this on either of the following well-known  and incredibly well-respected (yes I'm being ironic) 'business' communications platforms, FACEBOOK and INSTAGRAM - which it seems will lead to a much speedier resolution than their own dynamic TOBi Artificial Indiot (AI) or through there own platform Chat Assistants. That says something! Even they don't rate their customers chances of a useful resolution through their own business platforms. Sadly, I have neither Facebook or Instagram and am not about to sign-up to either just to recycle this situation.

He did his best to give my mom and I the best experience as well as getting done on time for us to catch our bus and he was successful. He helped us to understand what would be the best contract for me, explained everything in detail to help us understand ( which was great because we're not the greatest when it comes to tech) and he was really patient. If for no other reason, we would definitely come back just because of him.

So far 15 minutes on hold.... Call time over 40 mins so far!Agent finally returned to advise she spoke to technical help and they have adjusted the minimum speed gaurentee to 400 MbpsYet I signed up for 500 Mbps I accepted this as a temporary measure Ran some new tests and speeds now improved a little ranging for 170 to 237 MbpsStill not the 500 Mbps I signed up for and still not the speed gaurenteeWhy can't they just set my minimum speed to 500 Mbps the have the facility to do it!So far vodaphone fibre don't seem to be educated on the minimum speed gaurentee, let alone attempt to save me as a customer, we moved from sky and have to say is the worst decision we have made we will be moving back23rd Nov 240 Mbps DownloadedUPDATE, I have called to upgrade to 900Mbps and it now won't go over 260mbps fault number : FLT12203896They ran tests and then asked me to do various tests using LAN and WiFi etc which I done , I then sent screenshots as requested,I called again and spoke to a guy who said he had unblocked some stuff not sure what he meant but upload increased , yet download still no where near the 900mbps I can't even get over 300mbpsCalled again and new agent said he had to raise another fault , I advised I already done this! At this point I asked to cancel as going round in circles! He transfered me though to cancellations who advised I have to allow them 60 days to resolve the issue 60 days!!! So much for the minimum speed gaurentee I'm absolutely sick of this company and I implore anyone considering Vodafone fibre to think againBack to tech help from cancellations who advised they can't detect a fault so can't send an engineer, I advised if they can't give me the gaurenteed speed or send an engineer surely I can cancel! He passed me back to cancellations who advised I would get ETC charges I advised tech help can't send an engineer or fix the speed issue , but the cancellation advisor yet still ignored me and must be reading of a script , got passed back to tech help to do more tests at this point I have been on the phone over 2 hours and going round in circlesI have said I will call back next day , will update this review accordingly Why is it so hard to give a simple resolution to a end user , they can't send an engineer or fix the speed issue so surely they should have a process which will allow me to move to another provider without ETC chargesIt seems there is no communication between departments and vodaphone are very difficult to deal with # 500mbps and 900Mbps review",Negative,-0.041198254870129875

My Router was delayed, DPD didn‚Äôt deliver and sent the original Vodafone router back to the depot, after hours speaking to Vodafone a router finally made its way to me. Before it was handed over to me the DPD driver asked for my old router so I gave them the BT one. This is where the problem started, they shouldn‚Äôt have taken my BT router and now after hours of discussion they have said they can‚Äôt sent it back leaving me with a ¬£50 bill. As this wasn‚Äôt my fault I asked if I could be compensated in some way and nothing. Their manager can‚Äôt do anything and they deny being able to talk to the warehouse even though they told me they had and that my router was there. Apparently they can‚Äôt call the warehouse to put my router in a box for me to arrange for it to be picked up. The whole onboarding service has been rubbish and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to anyone. Patch service some good people some not so good. I was told my router would be delivered back in 10 working days and that apparently was a lie. They may offer a good deal but be wary of the hassle you will get. I was going to move my mobile to Vodafone and those of the family but I will NOT be doing that now. # Broadband Returned Router - Poor Service",Positive,0.13888888888888887
