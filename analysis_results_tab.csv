The network has been down five times during my contract and no automatic reduction in bill, first time it was down for two days I spent three hours on the phone and they reduced my bill by £5. Data coverage across the UK is patchy, and often says it has connection but it is unusable. Brand new high spec phone a city (that three claims it has 90% coverage with 5G) can't use data reliably. The shops also cannot help with anything other then selling you new contracts or pay as you go Sims which is frustrating and seems like a waste of retail space.

And the last email asked me to get back to customer service and they would resolve it.This was an incredible waste of time just for £15, and at the end I gave up.

They said yes it's their mistake and the cash will be refunded in 7 working days, it was only yesterday that I discovered they hadn't. I've now had to get In touch with my bank to stop them taking anymore cash. I also asked for the last 12 months paper statements so I can find out how much more three has taken from me. I had a call back today from three and they say it will take 30 days to stop this account and I will get my £60 back 7 working days after that. I'm disabled and we're in the middle of a cost of living crisis and these clowns think it's acceptable to rob me then pay it back in a month and 9 days time.

They offered no help at all. In the end I asked for both my contract and my wife's to be terminated as missold. They refused even this asking for £280 to cancel a missold contract not fit for purpose. I made two official complaints online, both they refused to budge an inch or assume any culpability. I went back to the Bangor, County Down store to contest. The staff did not know what to do. The manager tried in some pathetic way to respond in a bully type aggressive way. He promised in the end to lodge the complaint but clearly months later did absolutely nothing. He tried to position that really it was my word against theirs and so nothing would be done. This assumes I buy contracts that are ABSOLUTELY no use to me.

Two months later they were still charging me and said my contract continued because I did not activate the PUK code they then refunded me £2.31 even though I had not used the telephone number or network for eight weeks.

I told them about this and requested my £15 or £20 back in extra charges as how was I supposed to know that my direct debit was apparently cancelled yet I was never told and their website stated all was well. They told me to email proof to an email address, I did this and 10 days later, still no response.Inept company, same with their customer service, definitely a language barrier as they're using Indian call centres.

Three,1,TH,1,Horrendous Customer Experience - Avoid At All Costs,18-Apr-24,c59c7e73-ea4c-4b3b-b916-a5c8fefdfd49,"Three set up a duplicate contract with a phone number I had never used, with a second direct debit coming out every month since November 2021 when I switched my regular contract. At first I thought it was fraudulent but later came to the conclusion it was sheer incompetence / dishonesty and would not trust a word they say. Their customer care experience is utterly useless, having been literally lied to on the phone about my second contract being cancelled and having to wait weeks for my online complaint to be 'dealt' with. Exiting the contract I had never used brought me to literal tears, as I could not register the duplicate number for a MyThree account (to cancel manually), since my email for the account was the same as my actual Three contract...leaving me feeling extremely trapped and being forced to pay the final monthly fee of £10.92 just to be done with the nonsense. To add insult to injury there is also a final bill on the way for the service I never asked for and never used.The behaviour of this company is by far the worst I have ever witnessed and I am gobsmacked at the level of disingenuity / borderline corruption I have observed from multiple teams / touchpoints. You cannot get a straight answer out of any of their teams, nor trust a word they say.I will be contacting the Telecom Ombudsman about this experience in the hopes of finally getting a refund for this duplicate contract I never asked for and will be speaking with the necessary authorities about how they conduct themselves.Absolute shambles of a company who should cease to exist based on how they treat their loyal customers. # Horrendous Customer Experience - Avoid At All Costs",Negative,-0.059848485

My experience with Three UK unfortunately fell short of expectations.Firstly, their customer service left much to be desired. On multiple occasions, I encountered long wait times and unhelpful representatives who seemed more interested in rushing through calls than addressing my concerns.Secondly, the network coverage proved to be unreliable in many areas. Despite promises of fast and consistent service, I frequently experienced dropped calls and slow internet speeds, even in areas where coverage was supposed to be strong.Lastly, their billing system was a source of frustration. I encountered numerous billing errors and discrepancies, which required extensive time and effort to resolve. It was disappointing to see such a lack of accuracy and accountability in their billing practices.Overall, my experience with Three UK was disappointing.

When three broadband goes down, which it will, so do your three mobile phones, and if like me, you work from home that just isn’t going to work. Especially when they decide (without telling me) they are going to upgrade the mast which will take around 4-5 days to complete! No resilience to another mast or service. (O2 data working fine in the same area).  So in my opinion, if you really rely on internet then have a wired or fibre connection and your mobile 4 or 5g as a backup.

It was Wednesday 17th; MAFS was on soon but I had time to kill and I gave Three a call. I was initially connected to somebody who spoke so fast and in such a broad accent, I hardly knew what he was saying. He kept asking for my information? What's my name and account details? I practically had to shout at him, 'I DO NOT HAVE AN ACCOUNT, I WANT TO JOIN THREE.' I should have known. It took a disturbing amount of time to communicate that I simply wanted to know what my options were for joining as a new customer from EE, before he transferred me to someone else. I was greeted by someone else who talked so fast, I could barely understand him either. I explained, again, that I wanted to join Three.We went through the usual rigmarole, what device do I want, how much data etc. I already knew what I wanted, but despite several attempts at stating that 6gb was enough for me, the agent insisted over and over again that the plan with '150gb data was a better deal for me, no?'No. It was not. I already knew that I averaged 1gb of data a month on my current network, I didn't need 150gb. (I really, really should have known.)the 55 minute long call, had me tearing my hair out. I don't know why I didn't just put the phone down. I was asked repeatedly for my name, email, DOB, address, income, bank information, PAC code, mobile. I gave him this information so many times I was exhausted. He explained the process so rapidly, I didn't know what he was saying, but I kept on the line. I went through a credit check where I gave the same information repeatedly - I cannot fathom why. Once I've passed the check surely there is no need to repeat my annual income? Towards the end of the phone call I received an email with a credit agreement. He stayed on the line whilst I looked it over and he told me I could read it another time and to sign it. I signed it. I was told Three were going to call me and I must answer it as they were to perform a 'security check'. Without passing it, my order would be cancelled. I got off the phone that evening sweaty and slightly hysterical.The next day at 11.51 I had the phone call from Three and I'm sure you saw it coming, I missed it. I was left a voicemail so jumbled and indecipherable, it was almost funny. I go online and get the number to call by 12.03pm.Another frustrating call ensued. More lengthy security checks, as well as an account of when, where and how I had placed the order the previous day.I’m told I have to visit a store for 'security purposes'. What security purposes? 'your account needs additional verification for security purposes, visit a store with valid ID'But why? 'For security purposes'. I go to Three, I explain the events and she responds 'WHY DO THEY KEEP DOING THIS!'I knew it was bad. She told me 'just wait it out'. I call Three back and start again: name, email DOB, security check. They speak to the store, my ID is scanned. they confirm their store details. Three put the phone down and call the store back on landline, they talk, they ask to talk to me. My check is done, however, my order is cancelled. I was furious. I go back to work baffled, it was a complete waste of time.I have spent hours since trying to get a straight answer. I’m told to dispute the payment with the bank. I’m told on the phone my order is cancelled but I receive no confirmation of that. I call them and nobody understands me, they thank me on live chat for visiting the store with ID. 2 mins later they tell me ‘you have to visit a store with ID’ ????I’m going round in circles. I go back to the store, they can't help. I speak again to live chat who tell me there is a block on my account. I call and finally get somewhere, the agent tells me he’s removing the 'blocks' and I can call back to place another order. I could laugh. I state very clearly that I need to cancel my contract (even though I had already been told it was done). After 40 minutes, I'm nearly in tears but it seems I’ve got there.

In summary, I ordered a PAYG SIM card from them, for collection in store, and paid £10 up front for it. I never received any notification that the card was ready for collection, so contacted their live chat after a few days, who told me firstly that there was a delay in delivery, and then when I contacted them again a couple of days later that the SIM was available and I should visit the store. I subsequently visited the store and spoke to a customer service representative there, and was told that (to quote) ""the system for ordering SIMs for collection from store has been broken for ages, we've told the company but they haven't done anything about it."". I was told further that they couldn't provide the card in store, they couldn't cancel my order, and they couldn't refund me. I asked to see their manager and, after some discussions (I presume) behind closed doors, was told by the representative that the manager was not available. They told me to call Three directly. After disputing and wasting over an hour of my valuable time, I left the store. I then called Three on their customer service number and was told (after waiting in their call queue) to visit the store (again). My patience was exhausted by then, so I simply demanded, again, cancellation of the order and a refund. They said they'd look into it and call me back a few days later. When I eventually spoke to them on the phone again, I was told there was nothing they could do and I must visit the store again (presumably to be told, as before, that there was nothing they could do in store and I'd have to call Three).The whole situation is crazily Kafkaesque, with neither the store nor the central customer service team (whoever and wherever they may be) being willing to take any responsibility for the situation, and would be amusing if it wasn't for the fact that I have been relieved of £10 of my money by this company, and they have given me nothing in return. They seem unable to simply cancel the order and refund. This feels like an unethical and (eventually, if my money is not returned to me) an unlawful way of conducting business.Needless to say, I've lodged an official complaint using their complaints form (which I’m not particularly confident will produce any positive results), and I intend to raise a dispute against the company via my bank, in the hope of recovering my money.I'd advise anyone to be extremely cautious and think carefully before doing business with Three, in case you become entangled, as I seem to have been, in their incompetent corporate machinery, with little hope of redress. # Money taken and nothing received in return",Negative,-0.065246212

Despite being told over weeks that 5g will become available - it wasnt. then began the process of getting a refund for a fraudulent product and cancellation. This took me several months to do. they tried to charge me for cancelling despite being sold a fraudulent product and i had to fight for a full refund - they tried to take money from me for an early cancellation fee and refused to give me a refund until i threatened to take it legal. they said i would need to return within 30 days my 5g hub and will send a returns label. I did not recieve this and at day 15 I mentioned this to them - they sent me the label on day 28 leaving me no time to send it back as i was on holiday. I then had to repeat the above process to gt a refund and cancellation where they again refused, tried to charge me- eventually they gave in after hours and hours of arguments from my end. upon confirmation of return of the hub, they ""cancelled"" my contract, however noticed they were still charging my card for the last 6 months for this hub, and was sent a threatening email saying if i dont pay- they will contact the credit companies to lower my credit.

Three,14,GB,1,Terrible experience trying to renew Contract.,08-Apr-24,8656202a-e224-4331-9dc7-8e43520cacfe,"Having been informed that my contract was nearly up 3 gave me options as to what package of service I could have when renewing. The default was that if I did nothing my current package would continue but the cost would be 50% higher! Unacceptable. So I called them to advise them that I would take a new 24 month contract meaning the cost would be much as I am currently paying. After 36 minutes on the phone I still had not got the new deal that 3 offered me. I was on my second advisor that the 1st. ('Mina') had transferred me to. 'Veronica' talked very fast with an accent that made it very difficult to follow her endless questions which were all information about me that 3 has had for many years. A number of times I had to request her to repeat what she had gabbled more slowly, but she soon relapsed into her rapid style. I was put on hold a number of times and eventually when she said she would put the new contract in place she indicated it could take another 20 minutes more. At this point I requested that she initiate the new contract and told her I had no more time to waste and that 36 minutes already was excessive as far as far as I was concerned, and ended my call. I later received a text telling me that no new contract was set up! The implication being that I would be left on default and suffer the 50% increase. This was the point that I decided to seek another provider. # Terrible experience trying to renew Contract.",Positive,0.000490909

I made a complaint to their Customer Relations Team and I asked for compensation in the form of bill credit for the inconvenience, frustration and for wasting my time for 2 hours; they simply said ""we are unable to apply any bill credit to your account because the issue is fixed"".I told them I fixed the issue myself and I was told ""I'm glad you were able to fix the issue yourself, it saved us a job of fixing it"".

I think three is working with scammers just to rob people. I have been calling them to let them know that i have been receiving calls and texts from three telling me that im behind on my payments which i am not and the bills i have been receiving are for devices i didnt take. I called to report several times but they keep saying we are investigating its been more than a month now since they said they are investigating but no resolution whatsoever. They keep saying there is a dedicated team working on this and the dedicates team is dedicated on allowing scammers to have access to my accounts hence i said they are working together because how come scammers have all my details i shared with 3 . Three took 120 from account this morning and i have been calling them to ask why and they keep saying your case is under investigation so if it is under investigation how come they are taking money from my account when they know they are bills of devices taken by scammers and i have repeatedly told them i do not have these devices. I want to cancel my contract and they are telling me i have to pay 400 pounds termination charges . # Absolute nightmare,Positive,0.1

Final bills can take up to 38 days to arrive, but you'll usually receive this in the post as soon as it's ready.Usually if this is in credit by more than 50p, your refund will be processed within 14 days. If you've not received an expected refund within this timescale, please get in touch here:Thanks,Jonathan  EDIT 13/04/2024  They've just sent me a bill for the month after I left them. What's that all about?  I'm now using Lebara, getting what I need from a mobile as well as 100 minutes overseas for £5 a month using Vodaphone's network. This lot are useless and I think some of them may come from the middle of Scunthorpe, considering their attitude when trying to talk to them.

Three,1,GB,1,Completely useless phone service and even more inept customer service,17-Apr-24,d13f60f5-d328-4d34-bb6e-824264522a58,"I took out a Three Broadband device in store and ended up returning it within the cooling off period because the connection was terrible and unreliable in my area. Firstly they make ending the contract difficult. If you bought in store you have to go to that physical store to cancel rather than simply calling to end it and sending the device back by post. I leave the device back in store and was told to check with customer service that the contract has actually been cancelled. I do that and the CS team tell me it’s not, and that they have no way to communicate with the store and for me to call the store to sort it out. Thing is—the store never picks up the phone. It took me four days of calling to get through and they then tell me to speak to the CS team.I lodge a complaint about their completely inept service and the a couple of days later receive a text message from three that they attempted to call me, with no missed calls on my phone. While I’m looking at my phone I receive a call and immediately answer only for the person to immediately hang up. This is all within the space of 2 seconds. It was clear receiving the text about the missed call before they actually tried to call me that this was just a case of them trying to close the case as soon as possibleI call back and then get told that the case was closed, and they have to reopen it and I have to wait another few days for a call back. There’s no way for me to call the complaints team. This gives you a taste of the horrendous service that awaits you. Go with any other network. Their service isn’t even that reliable compared to others who are just as cheapIn response to Three’s message, I have contacted you multiple times, and had four calls from you yesterday even; and only after 40 minutes of back and forth did your complaints officer FINALLY agree that they would get someone from the logistics department to coordinate directly with the Three store where I left in the device and they failed to register that I had cancelled the contract. Why after more than 20 calls in the past week did you suddenly manage to communicate between departments after telling me over and over again that there was no possibility for them to communicate and I had to be the interloper going back and forth between the store and your awful customer service? Why could you not simply call the store yourself to figure out what was wrong? I should not have to be the one to sort out your bureaucratic company mess. I should not have to contact you each time. I expect you to actually look into the problem that you created, solve it, and come back to me with a solution. # Completely useless phone service and even more inept customer service",Negative,-0.094736842

Three,39,FR,5,Appalling mobile signal for years from 3 but great information from Joshua in the Technical Division 3,09-Apr-24,34d213d7-0dc1-461a-b5ed-a90c73253662,"I have lived in a flat just outside the city centre of Newcastle for years with terrible mobile phone signal. The problem is doubtless due to the early 80s construction of my home - a Faraday cage -but pleas for help or advice to the three stores have always fallen on deaf ears. No one in store has ever been able to tell me how my service could be improved though a few years ago, it was suggested that moving might be the best solution. A intended joke but it was not at all appreciated. Recently I tried again and new advisor asked the manager what I might be able to do and I was told to see what advice the Technical Division could recommend. I had tried that route previously. By chance, on this occasion, I came across Jonathanan, a most courteous & knowledgeable adviser who took me through various steps to help me forward though the problem is that G3 is being withdrawn while 4G is not yet available to me on the main road through the leafy suburb of Jesmond, even though I have bought three so-called 5G mobile smartphones via 3 over the past few years and am within easy walking distance to the city centre and the 3 store. Joshua tried really hard to help and deserves a lot of credit for his friendly efforts despite the conclusion that nothing can currently done to provide reliably even one bar of mobile signal. I already use wifi phone calls but that, too, is unreliable. Joshua told me that, although the signals in my area are heavily congested, nothing can be done except to wait until a decent 4G signal is available where I live, although the opposite, parallel, less significant road 50yds to the west is already provided with 5G. So appalling mobile provision by 3 in 2024 and for years here. And nothing, apparently, can be done about it until 5G is rolled out here. I think I managed better on 3G when online payments were possible but now simply end in constant buffering. But thanks to Joshua for his excellent service.

Three,1,GB,1,Three UK,16-Apr-24,90080290-72f5-4e78-bbf8-da15fbf4b01a,"Three UKWell I must say my first impressions of Three UK are not great, I've been with a number of providers over the years O2, Vodaphone, Orange, One to One, EE, Honest, and now Three UK.Three have by far been the absolute worst joining experience I've ever had, and believe be given some of the companies in the list above, the bar was not all that high. However, Three UK have come in and lowered that Bar to new depths.So today was supposed to be the day my number ported from Honest to Three UK, a supposed relatively simple process considering Honest is Three UK kinda.So as advised in the post sales communications I popped the new Three UK sim in my phone this morning because the port would not initiate without the new sim in the phone. Advised friends and family to contact me via WhatsApp or other such service while the port happens.So now we come to the port, confirmed with Honest that the number has ported out and my Three UK app shows the ported number as being the number for my account. However, the number seems to have disappeared and I am unable to make calls use mobile data or send text messages. When dialing the ported number I and others are told that that number no longer exists. So I think to myself 'self lets contact some of this fantastic support all the pre and post sales communications told me about'. Oh how naive was I. Firstly the Chatbot, what an experience and 10 minutes of my life I will never get back, gave me no more information than I could have found in 2 minutes on the Three website. Don't worry folks if you think AI is going to replace the human element Three UK have a long way to go, or at least so I thought until the Chatbot transferred me to a 'real person'.So Kaif came on the chat told me he would be happy to help me and then ghosted me for 5 minutes. When he came back he asked me to go through all the account based security questions the Chatbot had already asked so another 5 minutes wasted. Then he ghosted me again for another couple of minutes and when he came back he asked me to confirm the number which I did for the third time now and he went off to make another brew or provide time wasting responses to some other lost soul.At this point he decided to tell me he was going to send and email with a code to the email on my account, an obvious new delaying tactic considering I had already gone through account security twice by this point but hey ho gotta give him points for coming up with another delaying tactic. So email received and one time code given to Kaif and he ghosted me again (at this time I'm getting flashbacks to dating in the 90's).When he came back he advised me that ""I request you to please observe the services i will be working till today's end of the day or tomorrow morning for you"" sic, and he promptly ended the chat. So I decided to go to the Three UK website and post this to the community there in the hope I would get some support. How naive I was yet again, I logged in or at least tried to because as part of the log in process they sent a text to the phone I can't use because Three UK can get a simple number port correct. So here I am first full day of service (lets not be to hasty) provided by Three UK and I am unable to make use of my mobile phone at all. So any help from a person who can actually help and not provide platitudes and even worse service than I already have would be great. Lets see if that bar can be moved up a notch or two higher.Thanks,A disappointed new customer # Three UK",Positive,0.031465677

I did not need a new phone at the end of my second contract so I decided not to renew my contract with Three and switch to pay as you go with another competitor. I swapped back to Three pay as you go a few months later to compare network coverage and this is where all my problems began.There is a massive focus on using the Three App to manage your account. When I tried to log in to the app to manage my pay as you go account, a message appeared saying that my account with Three had been closed. I contacted customer support to resolve this and they told me to wait 2 days and then get back in touch if I could not log in. I was not able to log in 2 days later so I got back in touch and they told me to wait another two days. It was difficult to get access to support on the live chat. You have to deal with an automated chat bot and then answer a series of questions (mobile number, email address, first name, last name, date of birth, post code) before you are put through to a live agent. Sometimes you answer all these questions and the chat is terminated, saying that no agents are available (at regular times like 11am).I continued shopping around and decided to move to another carrier. As I did not have access to my online account through the app, I got back in touch with online support to request that they cancel the next payment to be taken from my card and provide me with a PAC code. They confirmed that the payment had been cancelled and that the payment would not be taken. I waited until the day my allowance ran out and surprise surprise, the next payment was taken and I had another month of allowance added to my account. I got back in touch with support and they told me that I was charged because I did not use my PAC code before the renewal date. I asked if I would be refunded for the data that had been purchased if I used my PAC code right away and they said that I would be refunded for any data I did not use.I used my PAC code right away and was ported over to my new carrier a couple days later without using any Three services. I thought it best to wait a month for the refund to come through before contacting support again.It's now over a month since my number was ported over to my new carrier and I'm yet to see a refund on my account. So I got back in touch with support and after a 45 minute conversation where the agent disappeared for over 10 minutes at a time, I was told that they are not able to refund anything to me as a data bundle had already been purchased. They then disconnected the chat after 4 minutes of me not replying despite me saying that I had to go in to a meeting and that I would be slow to reply.This is blatant theft in my opinion, I am furious and I am left with no options to escalate my query further. I would advise you to stay as far away from Three as possible. Truly the worst customer service of all the carriers in the UK # Blatant Theft, Disrespect and No Way to Escalate",Positive,0.015081169

They said I need at least £51 to £100 on the account then i asked them why do I need that so they replied was like is to receive or make calls from UK numbers and they said that would stay there if you don’t use the credit so said to cancel it but they said they couldn’t cancel.

The alternatives are other providers' 5G offerings since Jelson Homes decided in the late 2010s that an estate didn't need Fibre broadband to cheap out. Was a joy during lockdown especially. 5G is FAST with 3... but very very inconsistent. Have had 500mbps but usually sit around 150-200. That's fine for our household but what isn't is the compete cutting of service... between 2023 and 2024 I'd say we've been taken offline/ down to barely at all usable speeds (with a red light on the router) about 5 or 6 times possibly even. One time we had zero broadband for a couple days and my mum who is WFH had to drive into work at zero notice to actually do her job. Only writing this right now because along with everyone else on my estate my 3 5G is down to abysmal speeds at 4G again - with no notice, warning, apology, compensation. Supposedly removing the 3G in the area as per gov. recommendations but having to learn that from an engineer working on the mast? At least the Zyxel ISP router hasn't bricked itself this time like last, caused by the Three nationwide outage a month or so ago.As you can tell, I was initially very impressed with the price to performance of Three. Very fast and honestly, especially when they lock you into a contract (they haven't me), very cheap. But don't let them lock you in. No broadband is unacceptable and having barely any is also unacceptable when it happens this often and for this long. Even BT over poorly installed copper wasn't THIS bad. Sort it out!!!

Soooo I made three aware I would like to cancel my contract at the beginning of March 2024 to be told I had to call three on the 19th which was the day before my contract ended to conclude this and they would cancel the contract for me. I did as I was told to do so and called on the 19th, to then be told “No Miss Sheehan you needed to give us 30 days notice in order for us to process the cancellation” and they would have to “put in a request for my contract to end” which would take up to 72 hours.. as you can imagine I was absolutely raging at them and refused to end the phone call before speaking to a manager. They quickly changed their attitude and said they would make sure the account was closed. I waited 72hours and called back to ensure this had been done to be told AGAIN they would have to request this cancellation on the system and that the system had “glitched” (how convenient for them). By this point I was absolutely furious and contacted the financial ombudsman to which they advised me to contact three and ask them to send me a “deadlock” via email and request allllll of my information ie phone recordings; notes on the system they had added onto my account etc. I called Three straight back and they miraculously found the cancel now button on there system 😅.. I still requested a manager call me as I was not convinced. 3 days later a manager finally calls and I asked him specific questions .. “is my contract completely cancelled?” “Will there be anymore bills as it is all paid up to my knowledge?” The MANAGER confirmed that I had no more bills left to pay, and I asked that all of my personal info be deleted ie bank details. I never had a direct debit set up as I always called the 1st or 2nd of the month to pay manually as I do with all my bills (it’s just how I like to pay things as I write things down etc once paid and pay all my bills on the same day) …..

Three,13,GB,1,Struggling with Data Conversion: A of Three's Service,02-Apr-24,1448672a-3299-4c23-bdee-9d20bb09ffc9,"I've recently encountered a significant issue with Three that has put a spanner in the works for my live streaming business. Their system allows me to top up and accumulate ""cash credit,"" which sounds handy at first glance. However, the crux of the problem is converting this credit into the data I desperately need. Given that the SIM card I use is ensconced in a USB dongle - integral to my setup - I'm in a real bind. This setup makes it impossible to receive texts, a crucial step for activating various services.Reaching out for assistance hasn't been smooth sailing. My initial attempts to get help over the phone were met with an automated response, nudging me towards their website - a merry-go-round that led nowhere. The live chat option did eventually put me in touch with someone, but not without eating into valuable time that could have been spent elsewhere.The heart of my frustration lies in the apparent oversight in Three's app functionality. It's bewildering that a company of their stature hasn't made it straightforward to convert cash credit into data directly through their app, sans the need for a tech support middleman. This loophole seems to render the whole idea of ""cash credit"" somewhat moot, particularly for those in niche circumstances like mine.What's the point of cash credit if it becomes a Herculean task to utilise it for essential services? Three's current system feels like a missed opportunity to streamline and simplify the process for all users, leaving me to ponder the efficacy of sticking with their service for my business needs.In sum, yes, it's been a frustrating experience with Three, mainly due to their lack of direct options for converting cash credit to data within their app, a critical feature for live streaming operations like mine. # Struggling with Data Conversion: A of Three's Service",Positive,0.067929293

I purchased a new phone and asked for a new SIM card. I was told to go to a 3 shop and collect. This I did during the 3rd week of January. The shop told me that there was a technical fault and they could not issue the SIM. I phoned 3. I was told I must wait 72 hours ( that is 3 days) I went back to the 3 shop, waited 2 hours whilst they tried to sort out my SIM. Several phone calls later all resulting in waiting "" yes 72 hours for a reply to my complaint"" with no result. Then I was told that the problem had been resolved,go to the 3¹Shop and collect my new SIM card. This I did. They fitted the new card,and told me it could take up to 24 hours to activate. 36 hours later it was still not activated. I rang 3 again. Just to be told there was a technical problem and the engineers were working on it. 1 month later still no SIM card. Then I made my weekly call to complain but the auto answer said the contract no longer existed! Someone ( not me had canceled it) I complained and reported they were in breach of contract!! They told me a serious data breach had occurred and an official complaint would be activated. I was then put in touch with a complaints manager. Who has not done anything to get my contract re activated. It is now 1st 4 2024.I have concluded that 3 customer services is not fit fir purpose.

Three,2,GB,1,One month update,30-Mar-24,5379aa41-bbf1-476f-9dd7-938bbdb25f1c,"I left a one month ago explaining how I was scammed into cancelling my new contract as they told me there was no way I could transfer my current number through to this new contract due to the fact that it is within the same mobile provider, only to be put through the sales team on the live chat and offered a different ""deal"" that was £20 more expensive each month in order to keep my original number. Not only this, but I was treated by the most aggressive and rude customer service agents I have ever come across. Never in my life have I felt compelled to leave a negative until this experience with three.After then doing my own research, and seeing how it is in fact very possible to keep my original number (albeit, having to do it all myself and transfer to another mobile provider on a cheap SIM deal, only to use the PAC code to transfer right back), I requested to reverse my cancellation request within the hour due to the incorrect and aggressive advice that one of their customer service agents provided me.Which now leads me to the present moment, one month later, where I have still been unable to use my new phone from when I received it, and nearly four months since I signed the new contract, where my issue has not been dealt with. My account remains suspended while they wait for their ""backend"" team to reverse the cancellation request, and reinstate my new contract.I have now been passed through at least a dozen agents, where I have to repeat myself every single time, spending at a minimum 2 hours of my time on the live chats every few days, only to be given the ""promise"" that they are looking into it and will update me with a call X amount of days away. This has happened every single week for an entire month now, where I have been told multiple times that the case is being escalated.The final straw was last night, where I received a text stating that three would call me with an update at the exact time they were calling me. I unfortunately missed this call by thirty seconds, and when I tried to call back, I was told they were closed for the night (this was clearly an intentional tactic, so that I had to go through their webchat yet again). They then closed my open case immediately after this missed call for a SECOND time without my consent, or an update as to what they are doing to resolve it. Their reason for this was stating that I was uncontactable.Not only this, but every time I speak to someone new, they blame me for not sending the new phone back, even though I was explicitly told to keep hold of it while they deal with my complaint. Especially as it would be a total waste of resources to send a brand new phone back, only to be sent the exact same make and model back again (and the fact that I spent money putting a new screen protector on said phone). I am also told that they sent me a returns label etc via email and post, which is a complete lie and I have received no such correspondence.I am a vulnerable customer, as are the countless others providing their, and the treatment I am receiving is putting an immense strain on me.After spending hours of my evening last night on the live chat yet again, I have been informed that my experience has been due to a ""technical glitch"" and they have escalated the case yet again and will update me on the 4th April. I have heard this exact statement every week now for the last month, and end up back at square one having to explain the reasoning for my complaint yet again.I am at an utter loss of how terribly this has been handled, and feel deeply for the thousands of others who are also having to go through this horrendous treatment.Please avoid them at all costs for the sake of your mental wellbeing and to protect the money that is in your bank account.

Three,1,GB,1,POOR SERVICE …,27-Mar-24,6bac567d-085b-409c-a464-0e1611c39bce,"I have a serious complaint against your service. I have been a loyal customer with THREE for several years now. But I have spent the last couple of days frantically going to the branches to check on the issue that I have not been receiving any incoming calls, especially from any other service provider and even SMS but yes I can make out going calls.After spending several hours in Three (Oxford Street) one of the customer service advisors advised me to get a replacement SIM card, for which I had to travel back and get my ID card. Upon getting the SIM replaced it still did not work. Then I was advised to go to the Apple store to get my I-phone checked , for which I had to make an appointment. So then I was advised to do a live chat with Apple customer care - I spent almost 4 hours following the steps/instructions he wanted me to do including diagnostics but all as in vain and finally I was told to go to Apple Store.I then decided to go to THREE stores (Wembley) from where I purchased the I-phone. There the customer service advised me to get my I-phone replaced since it was insured and most likely the problem of incoming calls can be resolved . After waiting for 50 minutes, the insurance team told  me to make a payment of 99 pound and I will receive a new I-phone against the existing one. After making the payment later I received an email mentioning I will get a refurbished I-phone. This is unbelievable in spite of me asking the agent earlier , she had confirmed a brand new I-phone. Why could I accept a refurbished I-phone if I am paying 100.72 pound per month against my 2 year contract. I then decided to go back to Three (oxford street) if they can resolve my issue otherwise I could change my service provider. Since I noticed that when I had exchanged my SIM in another mobile It didn't receive  any incoming calls. But when I placed another SIM ( another number) in my I-phone it worked, So it shouldn't be a problem with my I-phone? After so much harassment, stress, poor customer service advisors finally I had one customer servicer advisor (NIYAT in Oxford Street ) who was knowledgeable to inform me that if I had switch my contact number from a different service provider. For which I informed her Yes -From Vectone to Three which was couple of years back. She then mentioned that must be the issue why I am not receiving any incoming calls and she called Three service provider to reconfirm the same. I then receive the shocking news since Vectone has shut down operations in UK, all existing numbers which were transferred from Vectone to Three has this problem, and it has been 8 months. Isn't THREE as a company supposed to inform their customers via email or even a text message ?? Why I had to go through so many unnecessary stress which has lead me miss out of so many important calls/ time waste and energy. I was then inform by the advisor (Name-KEEGAN DMELLO) on call that I needed to change my existing contact number to a number provided by THREE (which will be FREE -Was he joking to say FREE after what I have been through- must be a real IDIOT) Do THREE and even he realise It is a nightmare for me to have my existing number changed in all my records. He then put me on hold to start the process of contact number change and he mentioned he waive off ( one time) 20 pound from my bill - 20 pound??? for all what I have through. And I did tell him it wasn't enough -Again he mentioned he would escalate the matter to his Manager and get back to me. After being on hold for 40 minutes, he mentions there is a technical problem and my number cant be changed today and definitely his Senior will call me tomorrow and have it sorted. Its  24 hours past now . No calls received neither my problem of receiving incoming calls have been resolved. BTW how is THREE going to call me if I can't receive incoming calls?I have gone through enough of harassment unnecessarily , it’s been 48 hours no calls received from so called Manger neither my problem has been resolved. # POOR SERVICE …",Negative,-0.029180099

Despite my attempts to switch to a SIM-only deal or close my account, they made it nearly impossible, leaving me trapped in a cycle of overcharging.When I tried to communicate my concerns, Three's customer service was unresponsive and dismissive. They refused to acknowledge my situation and instead escalated the issue to debt collectors, like Pastdue Credit Solutions, without providing me with a proper avenue to address the matter. Their demand for £170 for a phone I had already paid off, and for a SIM that was deactivated, was ludicrous and unjust.Dealing with Three became a nightmare. Their refusal to listen, their relentless charging, and their overall lack of regard for customer satisfaction were appalling. It's clear that they prioritize profits over people, leaving loyal customers like me feeling betrayed and exploited.I urge everyone to reconsider doing business with Three.

Staff in the shop have my number so won't answer the phone, so Tuesday after 8 blanked phone calls gets to the shop which is empty and 3 of them sat scratching their arses, won't return calls to the point where i'm at the shop at least once a week.I have had to cancel the direct debit to stop them taking a £140 out of my account again.Been passed from the guy i dealt with to the manageress to the area manager who's phone number they won't give you.

I tested it for less than a week and realized that it was impossible to use. Often everything worked very slowly, I could not even load the main page of Amazon, when checking the speed on fast.com it showed a speed of 150kbs. A week after I signed the contract, I finally called them with a strong decision to cancel the 24 months contract during the cool down period. There seemed to be nothing here, but then it became more interesting. I had to return the device via DPD and for this they had to send a return label. At the same time, it is not possible to return the modem to the store where I picked it up.And of course the label which should be sent to me within 2 days had not arrived, I contacted support several times to resolve this problem. As a result, they promised each time that “trust them and the label will come to my email within 2 days” and that I don’t owe them anything and I can ignore any notifications about payments. A month passed and I received a bunch of messages noticed that if I did not return the device, they would charge me 105 and then 115 pounds. However, I still had not received a return label from them. Meanwhile, the support continued to repeat “trust them and the label will be within 2 days”. After another half a month (at least 1.5 months in total), I finally received the label and eventually sent them their device.I thought the story was over, but today I received a post letter saying I owe them 10 pounds, with no explanation for what and threats that it would affect my credit rating! In my opinion, this looks not just like impudence, but like mockery. An attempt to log into the account and look is unsuccessful, because I no longer remember the phone number and there is no password from the account. Tomorrow during business hours I will have to call and figure it out again and find out what I have to pay for, I hope not for bothering their support service, wanting to return them as soon as possible...UPD: they charged me monthly for not returned device which was not returned due to Three's fault - they didn't provide a return label!

Short answers such as “no” and “right…give me a minute!” - then after 5 mins he said, I have set you up a payment plan of £11.58 with your direct debit details. That was that. No direct debit came out, and noticed this month, my credit score dropped due to a “missed payment” - I just spoke to Three on live chat and they told me, “no payment plan has been set up on your account” basically saying I’m lying. So I said, right, check the live chat transcript and they said “we can’t see you’ve contacted us about this” so here I am.

The upshot is my pristine credit file has been affected through the incompetence of the company and their broken way of communication which clearly wants an overhaul.

For the majority of the time their prices were somewhat competitive- I had to raise two complaints which were escalated to the ADR/ombudsman and upheld by them against Three. Their mobile service is generally ok, however the customer service has always been absolutely terrible!My last contract came to renewal and I was looking for a simple SIM only deal, as I was happy with my current handset. The best deal they could offer me was £20+ for less data; I was able to obtain almost four times the data allowance by switching to O2, billed at £8 per month (which also includes free European roaming).  In my last month of service with Three we travelled to Europe (Denmark and Sweden). I have a travel SIM and a mobile wifi hub, so my data roaming was turned off before leaving the UK. On my final bill, I was charged for two days of European roaming, coincidentally at the same minute Three text me when landing in Denmark and the same minute when we travelled across the border to Sweden, despite never turning my data roaming back on. I had to have the most painful conversation with customer services to have the charges refunded. Three were adamant the charges were correct - despite so many threads on their customer service forums with the same issue; and absolutely zero data usage. At this point I am convinced that Three are just attempting to scam money out of customers - I spent 30 minutes arguing with useless customer service agents for a grand total of £3 refund for charges they should never have billed me in the first place. Three used to be affordable/good value - now they are scam artists in the guise of a mobile phone operator who really do not care about customers and simply want to gouge money.

The transfer was pretty straight forward, but to actually cancel the account and ensure I wouldn't receive any extra bills has been a nightmare. I have had to sit on their ""customer service chat"" several times totalling almost two hours of mine wasted. I went through the complaints team (ref: 240306102017074) and was told the final bill would be waived, yet I received a bill in the post yesterday. I truly hope someone from Three will see this and get in touch with me to cancel this bill. Why do companies no longer have customer service via email? It's all so time consuming. # Great when using them as main phone provider but APPALLING when you need customer service",Positive,0.029984051

I complained several times to 3, and they always blamed my device, which works fine in other places. After checking with family, I found out that they have the same issue, and looking into it, the problem is extreme network congestion. After moving about a month ago, it gotten even worse, to the point where Dial Up internet would be an upgrade to what I'm getting at the moment. These issues persist to this day with no sign of changing.Tried talking to customer service several times about these issues, and they brush it off, they often don't understand the question due to a lack in English proficiency, and when I do hammer it home that the issue isn't on my end, they finally admit that the issue is with the network, and they're ""working on it"". Despite that promise, I saw no increase in the quality of the service, and I feel like I'm not being provided the service I pay for. I requested a copy of my contract's terms and conditions to try and verify 2 weeks ago, talked to several customer service reps about it, and they all promised to send it to my email address, but so far I have not received anything, and after double checking, my contact details are correct.Overall, it is the worst service I've ever received, they don't fix issues, ignore the customer, and try to ""reimburse"" you by giving you a partial credit on your bill, and they outsource customer service to companies with very little to no English proficiency.Absolutely not worth the money, I will not be renewing my contract, and they deserve the 1.3 star rating # The only consistent thing is the horrible service",Negative,-0.132175926

That's when my problems started,  Filling out the claim form was easy enough,  even getting it approved was straightforward.  BUT THAT IS WHERE THE SIMPLICITY ENDS!  Getting the new phone is like trying to climb Mount Everest whilst your hands and legs are tied and without oxygen.  The phone duely arrived, but the deliverer refused to give it over, unless we gave him the old phone. Apparently, you are supposed to backup your phone prior to this.  The flaw in the system is: 1.  How do you back up a phone, and 2.  What do you do in the meantime between wiping your old phone and receiving your new phone.  I am 67 years old and not overly tech savvy.  A phone for  me is to make a call and for emergencies.  It is distressing to me to be out and about without a phone, especially as I have diabetes, high blood pressure and a heart condition.  The service is not fit for purpose and shows a total disregard for the needs of the customers.  This level of service is likely to make me change to a provider who values a customer who is then not given a reason to leave.  I would give a lower rating if that were possible!Well here is an update!  It is 2nd April 2024 and I am still without a new phone.  Communications with Square Trade who provide the insurance is  virtually non existent.  They have made a verbal offer to replace my phone which seems reasonable but needs clarification.  Trying to get somebody to talk to me however is proving to be an insurmountable obstacle.  For a communications company there is a distinct lack any form a contact, whether it is email or phone or carrier pigeon! I would suggest they utilise AI as a solution to replace the stone wall they currently employ.

I have been experiencing difficulties accessing my account over the phone, and despite numerous attempts, your customer service representatives have been unable to resolve the issue remotely. Instead, I have been instructed to visit a 3 store, which is located approximately 25 miles away from my residence.I find this situation extremely inconvenient and frustrating for several reasons. Firstly, I have already made the effort to visit a 3 store in person, where I provided my photo ID as requested. However, during my visit, there was no mention of any issues with my account. Therefore, it is perplexing that I am now being instructed to make another trip to the store to address the same issue.As a loyal customer of 3 Network, I have consistently resolved any account-related matters and conducted upgrades over the phone in the past. The sudden requirement to visit a physical store is not only disruptive but also imposes significant inconveniences on my schedule. I work six days a week and do not have the flexibility to make such visits during business hours.I strongly urge 3 Network to accommodate customer concerns without causing unnecessary inconvenience. If it is absolutely necessary for me to visit a store, I request clarity on how my expenses and potential loss of earnings will be compensated. As a paying customer, I believe it is reasonable to expect efficient and accessible customer service.Should this issue remain unresolved, I am prepared to escalate my complaint to the appropriate regulatory bodies. It is my hope that 3 Network will take immediate action to rectify this situation and restore my confidence in your services. # Complaint Regarding Inaccessible Account and Inconvenient Service from 3 Network",Negative,-0.067741935

It was only kicking out a fraction of what it was meant to, so tried swapping the sim which caused enough hassle as they disabled the Internet until I got the new one which they said they wouldn't do. I ended up cancelling under the 30 day cooling off period so I wouldn't be charged. They told me to send the hub back and they would send me a dpd label to do it. No problem. I wait 24 to 48 hours, no dpd email. I call up a few days after that just incase it took 3 to 5 working days. They say they will send one again. I wait another week and nothing. This now goes on for another 4 weeks of me ringing them asking for the label and them telling me it will be sent. I always check my emails and junk most days at work so I know I never got one. After the 4th attempt at getting a label I gave up. I'm not wasting hours on the phone. After all this, another 3 phone calls later of back and forth of the same dribble, I finally get a label, 3 months after I have cancelled and stopped using the product.

I recently paid to upgrade my device (a whopping £250 to do so which was the best choice for me after pricing up my options as I've recently broken my phone). Online it stated I would receive the phone in two working days and that it was in stock, so I paid the fee and placed my order. I received no email confirmation, nothing. After 3 days, I decided to follow up with Three to get an update as I thought this was odd. I have spent the last almost 1.5 hours on Live Chat with zero meaningful resolution to my queries after finding out that I won't actually be receiving my device in the original timeframe despite the information I received during the ordering process. Nor would they advise when I'd expect to actually receive a confirmation email of my order.Any questions I asked or my escalation requests were met with zero support, and a failure to address my initial concerns. The Digital Assistant even said 'what do you expect me to do'.I reiterated to the support that I know it's not their fault, and that they may only be able to help me to a certain point, but I asked several times if there was someone else who could assist, or a number to call, or even just a clear breakdown of what was actually going on and the service I received was absolutely horrible. Nothing was moved forward and was such a waste of my time.I'm really disappointed in the support I received and wish I never placed an upgrade order. I even requested details on how to cancel an order, and the expected refund timeframe which they could not give me until I pressed them for an answer another two times. It almost feels like Three have deliberately made their customer support process difficult, including their help section and phone options when calling.

The download speed was fine (150Mbps), but the latency was so bad that some web pages failed to load! So I called them to cancel the contract. They agreed and said they'd send a label to return the router. They kept going on about having to return the router or getting charged £350. I wondered why they kept going on about it. 2. After several days I still hadn't received a returns label so I rang them again. This is where it gets awful. The system asks for your broadband number and other info, but STILL, it sends you to the wrong team. Anyway, after being passed back to the broadband team, they agreed I just need to send the router back. 3. I said ""Just give my the address and I'll send it there with signed for delivery"" but she could not!! Said she'd raise a request for a label.4. I said ""So you don't even have the authority to generate a label???"". No she can't. She's just there to bounce you around for a bit. 5. She then gave a long set of cautions about how I'd be charged if I didn't return the router by a certain date. I thought ""why do they keep going on about this?""6. I asked her to raise a 2nd request in case the first one didn't work. She denied. Then, after losing 30 minutes of my life, I ended the call. 7. Well, two days later and still  no label. I get it now. The router can't cost more than £100. So by charging me £350 for its non-return (or late return) they can make £250, which will offset the cost of the failed startup contract.Three.co.uk are very clever - but probably not in the way you wanted.8. I guess my only option is to ship the router myself to the company address, signed for delivery. Then when our dispute goes to court, I can show that I met the cancellation terms.

I had to purchase another contract with EE and continue to pay Three at the same time (a contract is a contract) just to be able to have a phone that works. The app, call line, chat are ALL useless because they rely on a security code sent to you by text to your Three number. My phone was so useless that it wouldn’t ever receive those texts, unbelievable. The frustration is next to none, I can feel my heart rate increasing just thinking about it. They waited for me to “not pay” for this new contract after the two year one I initially agreed to ended for THREE MONTHS before getting in touch with me by letter.

My guess is that everything was done through the app, but as I’ve mentioned, their provision is so terrible that I could not access the app.I now have months of ‘missed payments’ on my credit score that I will now no doubt have to fight with them to get removed because nothing is ever simple with this company.

Assistant male didnt talk to me, due to his religious beliefs or what. talked to my friend only. BAD SERVICEP.S.

Unfortunately the Three service was not fit for purpose as calls would frequently freeze.So I cancelled the service, I was advised this was cancelled within the 2 week period and no charges incurred.Since this time, I have had multiple calls with Three advising that the device had not been returned when I provided evidence that it had, including the signed for. a letter requesting £508.91 due to an early termination fee has been received a couple of times.December I was informed the device had been received and not to worry, but then got another letter for £508.91, I called again and went through the whole situation again, I cannot tell you how many times I have had to repeat the situation.Again in January I was told this had been sorted and they could see it had been returned and there would be no fee.Again 5th Feb another letter arrived for £508.91, I called and was assured this was sorted, I asked for confirmation but was assured this was sorted and no letter required.Today, 27th February, I have an email from a debt collector CRS requesting £508.91. I have never been in this situation, to have a debt collector after me!I have called Three again and been told that it is sorted, however they are refusing to send any confirmation of this via email or letter. I informed them that I have been informed of this multiple times already,  yet here I am in a worse situation. I was advised there was a technical problem back in January which is why the case was not picked up, and subsequently caused this to be passed to the debt agency. I can guarantee that a debt agency will not take my word that this is sorted with Three. I do not wish to have a debt against my name.I am at a loss for words with the process. Three will happily request money, but will not provide updates on case via email or letter? How can a customer be assured of the situation, which in my case has failed multiple times.The call started at 20:02, it ended at 22:34.I am a single mum, I don’t have a spare £500, I am extremely careful with my funds each month.What has happened? Why was there a technical glitch which caused my case to be lost and be in this situation?.Why was this glitch not identified and remediated?It is unlikely this was an isolated instance and there are must be other people in this position.

Despite canceling my contract within the 14-day cooling-off period, I am now facing unwarranted charges totaling £1400.Upon signing up for a contract with Three Mobile, I encountered numerous issues, prompting me to reconsider my decision. Consequently, I exercised my right to cancel the contract within the stipulated cooling-off period. However, to my astonishment, Three Mobile is attempting to charge me an exorbitant sum, disregarding my timely cancellation.Despite providing clear evidence of the cancellation timeline, including emails confirming the cancellation request, Three Mobile has been unyielding in their pursuit of these charges. This lack of accountability and disregard for consumer rights is deeply troubling.I urge Three Mobile to my case promptly and retract the unjust charges. As a customer, I expected transparency, fairness, and respect for my rights, none of which have been demonstrated in this instance.In light of this experience, I caution others considering contracts with Three Mobile to thoroughly the terms and conditions and be wary of potential challenges in exercising their consumer rights.Sincerely,Catalin Catauta # Unfair Charges Despite Contract Cancellation Within Cooling-Off Period",Negative,-0.096753247

They tell me to ignore them and that all will be sorted when a final bill is created in a few weeks time.  What a joke of a system and not one I want my credit rating ruined over.

Three,2,GB,1,Three don’t want loyal customers. Only new ones,25-Feb-24,5826fa85-e709-448b-afcc-b2f51aac91f9,"I had no problems with Three for my first contract. They weren’t the best but, at the time, they were the cheapest. Fine.Having had no issues with them for the 2-year contract period, I decided to take out another contract with them. Biggest mistake I have ever made.Three do not allow Three to Three number changing. Not that anyone told me this when I set it up (on the contrary, I was told to provide a PAC code to them, and was told what to do when the phone came with said PAC code). I had to, on their later recommendation, change my phone number to another provider and then change my number from that provider back to Three. It was a major inconvenience! Whilst on this chat with the Three representatives, I was told that - as my old contract had ended - I would not be billed for it anymore…Fast forward to a month later and I was billed. When I asked for this money back (citing the previous chat, which I had a copy of) I was told that I had to wait for the ‘Final Bill.’ I asked what date I would receive my final bill. I was told “after your second bill after cancelling.” “Am I going to be charged incorrectly AGAIN?! What date?” I asked. The operator did not know, but said I couldn’t cancel my direct debit, as any refunds after the final bill would need this DD to be refunded. At this point, I was furious. It was too late to get out of the contract, 30 days having elapsed. I took matters into my own hands and cancelled the Direct Debit regardless. 2 weeks later I got the Final Bill and was refunded out of the blue. I felt relieved that I could finally just wait this contract out in peace and no longer had to panic (this is not a financially-sound time for us).A couple of weeks later, I went to log in to my account online to check the progress of the account switch now that the previous contract had been finalised. Both my phone number and email address are still attached to my old contract, despite my having spoken to several customer service advisors (all of which said different things and refused to read the transcripts their fellow colleagues had sent me). I contacted customer services AGAIN to access my account, only to be told I needed a different email address as mine was forever tethered to the old account. I explained that I only have one email address and asked if they couldn’t remove the email address from my old account. I was told that I’d have to create a new email address just for my phone account. The inconvenience/lack of transparency shown has been ridiculous. It is ludicrous that I should have to jump through so many hoops (and sell my information to so many other companies - firstly Tesco Mobile to get a SIM in order to get a PAC Code, and now having to make another email address) in order to remain a loyal customer.All of this inconvenience does not allow for the amount of time you have to wait in order to receive a response from the customer advisors in-between scripted platitudes.

My experience with them was so bad that I still feel the negativity when talking to any customer service agent two days after. The encounter was not only frustrating but also left me with a sense of disappointment.I called your customer service line on behalf of our client, who is facing difficulty paying her bills. I explained the situation and requested assistance in either canceling the service or at least changing the tariff to better suit her financial circumstances. However, the response I received was far from satisfactory.The representative I spoke with seemed disinterested and unhelpful. Despite my earnest request, they did not provide any viable solutions and instead transferred me from one service to another, requiring me to repeat all security questions at each juncture. This not only wasted valuable time but also added to the overall frustration of the situation.After going through the ordeal of being transferred multiple times without any resolution, I regrettably reached a point of giving up. The lack of assistance and the seemingly indifferent attitude displayed by your customer service team has left me deeply disappointed.Customer service is a critical aspect of any business, and the experience I encountered falls significantly short of the expected standard. I hope that you will take this feedback seriously and take steps to improve the quality of service provided by your customer support team.

EE's customer service was excellent in comparison, I got through quickly to someone in the UK (no longer the case for Three) and got things resolved and dealt with quickly without someone trying to oversell to me.  I cant wait until September comes around to get rid of my phone contract with Three as well.I was told they didnt want to lose me as a customer but the more the person I spoke to said, the more I wanted to leave.  When I moved to a month to month contract after my 2 year contract ended, I was told I could cancel any time within that month.  However, when I called to cancel, I was told I had to give 30 days notice unless I took the number with me.  This is not what was explained to me originally and equally, who takes a number with them on a data only SIM?  I feel Three has stolen an extra month's payment from me that I wont be using. # Service has taken a nose dive in the past year.",Positive,0.07811943

The reason I wanted to cancel my contract was because of their very poor service that was consistent for almost 4 months. Despite this, their customer service still said they can’t do anything about it as it is the rule. I accepted their offer of 6 months free data plan to avoid the early cancellation fee.

Three,3,GB,1,Nightmare on Queensway,21-Feb-24,433d8372-5658-4dc7-84ac-72e1d333826c,"Nightmare on Queensway: My Horrendous Experience with Three Phone ServiceTwo and five years ago, I made a grave mistake that haunts me to this day – stepping foot into a Three phone store on Queensway in Bayswater, London. Little did I know, I was about to embark on a journey of deception, incompetence, and sheer frustration.The salesman, if you could even call him that, was nothing short of a con artist and a swindler. With a silver tongue and deceitful promises, he convinced me to sign up for a phone service package that included a main number and three additional SIM cards, all for a whopping £100 per month. Little did I realize that this would be the beginning of my descent into telecom hell.Firstly, the salesman failed to even bother collecting my email address, resulting in me never receiving a contract or a bill throughout the entirety of my two-year tenure with Three. Talk about shady business practices.To add insult to injury, he erroneously assigned one of the SIM numbers as my main number, rendering my actual main number practically useless. This blunder led to a myriad of problems over the years, complicating communication and causing endless headaches.But the nightmare didn't end there. Despite being situated in the heart of London, the service provided by Three was abysmal, to say the least. My apartment might as well have been a black hole for reception, with my kids refusing to even touch the extra SIM cards due to their utter uselessness. Meanwhile, my American phone with T-Mobile enjoyed stellar reception, leaving me baffled as to how a UK-based provider could fail so miserably.Fast forward to last November when I finally decided to pull the plug on this debacle of a contract. Despite explaining my predicament and expressing my desire to terminate the contract, the customer service team displayed nothing short of incompetence and hostility. They not only failed to close down the main number and one of the SIMs as requested but also had the audacity to accuse me of lying about ever contacting them to cancel the contract when I called them in febraury after discovering that they had charged me £100 pounds 2 months after closing down the contract???It's as if Three is operating in some alternate reality where customer satisfaction is a foreign concept. They continue to charge me unjustly, dragging their feet in closing down my contract while I'm left in a state of perpetual frustration.Attempting to reach customer service has proven to be an exercise in futility, as the only numbers I can recall from the four provided are mysteriously absent from their system. It's Kafkaesque, reminiscent of a scene straight out of ""Brazil.""Three is not just a phone service provider; it's a cautionary tale of corporate greed and customer neglect. If you value your sanity and hard-earned money, steer clear of Three at all costs. As for me, I'll be taking them to court in a last-ditch effort to escape this ongoing nightmare. Three, consider yourself on notice – your days of preying on unsuspecting customers are numbered. In the meantime I switched to EE which is perfect in every possible way you could dream of how a phone service should operate. # Nightmare on Queensway",Negative,-0.051550388

Their lack of transparency, poor communication, and unwarranted charges make them an unreliable option for mobile service. Goodbye, Three – I will not be recommending your service to anyone in the future.I have been a customer of Three for over seven years, consistently paying my monthly fees without a single delay. However, I recently decided to terminate my contract due to the introduction of a roaming fee of £2 per day for data usage outside of the UK and poor data coverage all over the UK, which has significantly worsened over the last two years.Unfortunately, Three failed to collect the remaining £32 owed to them and neglected to inform me of this outstanding balance. Instead, six months after cancellation, I received a letter from debt collectors demanding not only the £32 but also an additional £39 service charge.Furthermore, my dissatisfaction extends beyond financial matters. During a trip to Dover, my phone unexpectedly connected to a network in France, incurring a £2 charge for minimal data usage. This happened to friends of mine too, and Three is not addressing the issue. For instance, GiffGaff offers its customers a 5GB allowance per month.In addition to these issues, it is worth noting that the data coverage provided by Three is so poor that it sometimes makes it impossible to use the network.If you are a current customer, you should consider alternatives with better network coverage and roaming allowances. # AVOID!! poor data coverage, no customer support, roaming fees...",Negative,-0.02194617

Signed up to 3 for phone and broadband having been told the coverage was ""excellent"" in my area. I received the phone sim and hub on 16th Feb. Went to set it all up on 19th and neither worked at all as the signal was so poor (hub runs off 4G so reliant on decent network). Immediately decided to return Entered the web address for returns on the order sheet - page not found! Called the customer service team and told them I wanted to cancel within the 14-day cooling off period as there was no coverage in my area and neither phone nor broadband worked at all. I was told no problem, that's all done; we'll email a confirmation and returns label. I had still heard nothing later that day so I called again and was told it can take 24-hrs to process but it's definitely been cancelled and ""if any charges are made on your account just ignore them"" What??!!! A full 2 days later (22nd Feb), I have still not received confirmation of cancellation or returns label and have how had an email welcoming me to Three!!!! I'm reading the on here from people saying they've been wrongly charged and had debts passed over to collectors and feeling so worried this is what is going to happen. Feels like a scam.Edit 22nd Feb in response to reply from  Three: the link to the web chat goes to a generic ""contact us"" page. Given the on here, I am not risking this option. I have now taken a day off work to try and sort this out and am going to drive to a Three shop.Update: went to Three shop. They couldn't cancel the contract or take the products to return as the order had been made online. However they did help me to speak to the customer service team, again. First person I spoke to was so rude and unpleasant and said something completely different to what I'd been told on 20th. Sales assistant kindly offered to take over and, after 45+ minutes on the phone with them, managed to confirm the contract had NOT been cancelled as previously confirmed, twice. She was able to get them to cancel the sim for the phone and confirm this in a text. She was unable to get any written confirmation that the broadband had been cancelled. If I've not received an email by 25th, I need to go back to the shop so she can call customer service again. I will have to wait until 19th March to see if I am charged for any of this BS, even though I haven't used either product and cancelled within 3 days of delivery (contract says 14 days to cancel for any reason). Seems like the people in the shops are great but have to battle with the useless customer service team same as the customers. I regret so much ever signing up for this contract and suspect this farce will continue for a while.Update 5th March: device confirmed as returned to Three by DPD on 28th Feb. This morning email from Three advising it has not been received and contract will therefore proceed. The only way to contact them is via useless sales team in Mumbai or live chat. DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! 18th March: further update on this sorry saga. Made a formal complaint, Three responded to confirm they had, in fact, received the hub. Hoped this would be my last contact with this shambles of a company but no. Today I received a bill for almost £25 despite never having used the phone sim or even unboxed the hub.

Three,2,GB,1,Urgent Request for Contract Termination: Addressing Three UK's Service and Legal Failures,19-Feb-24,a95cb1e8-1151-44e5-8f0a-38562160e977,"Following up on my previous, my experience with Three UK continues to be deeply unsatisfactory, leading to further frustration and inconvenience.After facing an extended period of inactivity with my SIM, which I had detailed earlier, I followed the advice of Three UK's customer service and visited one of their shops in hopes of resolving the issue. However, upon arrival, the in-store staff informed me that the only solution would be to take out a new contract. This advice was not only unexpected but also unacceptable, given that I had already entered into a contract for a service that was never provided.Feeling cornered by this unwarranted suggestion and the urgent need for a working mobile connection for my work, I made the decision to switch to Vodafone. Despite this switch, Three UK proceeded to set up a direct debit for the original, non-functioning service and has since refused to cancel it. This situation has added financial insult to injury, exacerbating my dissatisfaction with Three UK.Moreover, approximately one month into the ordeal, Mohsin from customer service offered to send a new SIM and asked me to cancel my Vodafone new contact. My trust in Three UK's ability to provide a reliable and timely service had already been irreparably damaged by their earlier inactions and misadvise.This entire experience has not only left me feeling disregarded as a customer but has also highlighted a significant lack of accountability on Three UK's part. The company's failure to activate my SIM, coupled with their insistence on maintaining a direct debit for an undelivered service, is unacceptable. Furthermore, their advice to sign a new contract instead of rectifying their service failure is both bewildering and unjust.In light of the ongoing issues I have faced with Three UK, including the failure to activate my SIM card as per the service agreement and the subsequent mismanagement of my account, I hereby request the immediate cancellation of my contract, without incurring any termination fees. This request is grounded in the principles of contract law, specifically regarding the failure to provide the agreed-upon service, constituting a breach of contract.Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, services must be carried out with reasonable care and skill. Given that my SIM card was never activated, Three UK has failed to meet this basic requirement. Furthermore, the advice to enter a new contract under these circumstances could be seen as misleading and unfair under the same Act.Additionally, the direct debit set up for a service that has not been provided raises concerns under the Direct Debit Guarantee scheme, which provides customers the right to a full and immediate refund of any payments taken in error. As such, the continuation of this direct debit is both unjustified and contrary to the principles of equity.Given these considerations, I assert that my right to cancel this contract without penalty is well-founded on legal grounds. I expect Three UK to acknowledge this breach of contract and to proceed with the cancellation of my contract forthwith, in accordance with consumer protection laws and regulations.This formal request serves as a notice for immediate action to rectify the situation, failing which I may have to consider further legal recourse to resolve this matter satisfactorily. # Urgent Request for Contract Termination: Addressing Three UK's Service and Legal Failures",Positive,0.038721562

Three,4,GB,1,This company only cares about money,17-Feb-24,7cefac97-bce6-464d-9e75-15a2541680b5,"This company only cares about money, nothing else. I am writing this as a contract customer who is leaving with immediate effect. I have been with them since early 2023, and have encountered a series of issues outlined below:Roaming charges: this company charged me ballpark £100 for data roaming to France/Italy(!) - a service that is offered free of charge by other networks! This charge was for less than a month's usage and the data was only used for maps and GPS services. The signal was terrible.Customer service: this is a joke as their customer service is based in, and managed by India. Instantly this introduces a communication barrier because they don't understand your accent and you don't understand theirs. When you try online chat, the 3 website automatically logs you out every 5 minutes or so, meaning you must restart the process of trying to connect with a chat agent!  This happened recently while I was mid-chat with an agent after being number 5 on the queue, I was then reconnected as number 30 on the queue, got cut off mid-chat again and third time around I was number 85 on the queue! Frustrating. In the end, I had to phone in.Billing (and stealing): they will charge you a £5 penalty each time your direct debit fails. I find this shocking especially because I went in and made the payment via debit card the moment I was notified that my direct debit had failed. Effectively, it is not a late payment charge. It is simply a process designed to fleece customers such that once a direct debit does not go through on the second try, they charge you for their time and effort by adding a whopping £5 to your next bill. This is an extortionate and old-fashioned practise and will lose you customers - myself included. If a direct debit fails and the customer goes in to pay the bill within 24hrs, there should be no charge! Another sticking point - my bill has gone from £8 a month (sim only) to £17 per month in the past 12 months, and this for 20gb with unlimited calls/messages. If that's not a rip-off, given the current climate, then I don't know what is! # This company only cares about money",Negative,-0.085416667

I hope they fair better. Three don't deserve any more of my time, money or energy.I gave them the benefit of the doubt but how they handled the situation was quite frankly abysmal. I am glad I am not locked into a contract with these imbeciles. If you like a company that lacks in transparency, has continual outages, being ripped off, being without a service for work, being gaslighted, non-stop disruption to your data, being inconvenienced by having to buy other devices (It's definitely not us it's something on your end dear irrespective of our social media updates and the media reportings!) a lack of accountability and dealing with agents and a technical team so inept it's frankly laughable then Three is the provider you're looking for. It's a merry-go-round of madness. Seriously we all need to start keeping it simple by buying our own devices outright (go with a finance company with low interest if needs be and you'll still be paying less overall for a device) and stop contracting with companies like this and it makes the task of leaving so much simpler! We're paying the price for instant gratification. If we keep buying what they're selling then they'll keep abusing their position.Even if you have to save or look at middle-range or budget handsets (which are frankly more robust and just as good if not better as any high-end phone half the time) it's worth it! At least you'll then own it outright instead of paying charlatans like this for the privilege and suffering 18-35 months of absolute misery.

Three,2,GB,1,Appalling and Kafkaesque interaction with Three,16-Feb-24,fd83a1fb-8b13-4a46-91a5-5c738c86d361,"On Tuesday 13 February 2024 I contacted Three Customer Service both by phone and chat. I explained that I was not able to view my bills when I log on to the App or on the website. A very simple request, one would think.After around 50 minutes talking to Customer Service Billing Department, the issue was still not resolved and I was amazed to be told that I would need separate email addresses and password to view EACH OF THE FOUR bills I pay for every month. Zero mention of this ridiculous requirement when I took additional contracts for two extra phone SIMS and a 5G broadband SIM.I was then completely exasperated at receiving zero resolution on a simple issue even though I had done what I was told and went ahead and used two other emails to access two of the three SIMS on my account. Although one of the accounts I was able to log on to showed a bill for that number, my main account did NOT display the bill for that number. The second account, my wife’s number, showed the bill for that number AND my bill! How crazy is that?So I went in person to my nearest Three store, on Wood Green High Road, London N22. Instead of getting the issue resolved there by a real live person, I get “We don’t have anything to do with the website or My3 App,” by one of the people working there. Then I was put on the phone to, you guessed it, Customer Service Billing Department in India again. After around 30 minutes sitting in the store in dialogue with them involving endless verification steps, one time codes, reset links etc. I was referred to the “technical team” for further security checks and verification codes exchanged etc. etc. and a firm promise that the issue would be immediately resolved.When I got home, I found that I STILL could not access my bill for my number and that my bill was STILL appearing on my wife’s account!!!! So I had been lied to. I then spent around two hours the next day on 14 February in dialogue with Customer Service in India. I asked to be transferred to Customer Service in the UK (strong accents and line drop-outs do not help when trying to negotiate the endless bureaucracy and processes that a Three customer is obliged to engage in when dealing with that team). After endless apologies and claims that “Soon the system will be updated so that you can see all your bills together” and “We are escalating your issue” and the by now endless security and verification steps, still no resolution.Next day 15 February I spent another hour on the phone with Customer Service Billing Department attempting to resolve these basic billing issues. Lots of apologies and excuses offered “We are resetting the system, yes I would be upset too, yes we have escalated your concern,” but no resolution. Customer Service Billing Department assured me someone from the Technical Department would get back to me, they never did. In the afternoon I then spent a further 40 minutes again talking to Customer Service Billing Department, involving the same Kafkaesque verification, security checks, apologies and expressions of sympathy and empathy. At this point I told Three that I would be resigning from all four of my SIMs and raising an official complaint with Ofcom if the matter was not sorted out within 24 hours. So today (16 February) I get a call from someone from the Complaints Department telling me the issue had not been resolved and that the email that I have been using to communicate with Three since 2022 was not the email registered to my account. I told him that was not my problem and that was an error in Three’s system and that I was not prepared to waste any more of my time given the complete failure of Three to resolve this very simple billing issue. The guy tells me that I will receive an email to my registered email address confirming my complaint, which I duly received…clear proof they had my registered email all along, bizarre and extremely frustrating. # Appalling and Kafkaesque interaction with Three",Negative,-0.044157428

My experience with them has been nothing short of a nightmare. Not only did they fail to provide the service they promised, but they also managed to steal £200 from my hard-earned money through their deceitful tactics.Firstly, let's talk about their customer service, or should I say the lack thereof. Trying to get in touch with a representative is like attempting to communicate with a brick wall. They're completely unhelpful!!!Now, onto the main issue – the theft of £200 from my device plan. It's bad enough that their service is subpar, but to add insult to injury by siphoning off money from unsuspecting customers is downright despicable. They conveniently slipped in hidden charges and fees without any prior notice or explanation, effectively robbing me blind.Not only have they shattered any semblance of trust I had in their company, but they've also left me significantly out of pocket. I feel utterly betrayed and taken advantage of by Three's deceptive practices.In conclusion, steer clear of Three unless you enjoy being swindled and treated like garbage. Save yourself the headache and go with a reputable provider that actually values its customers and operates with integrity. Three should be ashamed of themselves for their disgraceful conduct. # A Nightmare Experience: Three Stole £200 from My Device Plan!",Positive,0.00625

Went back into store to rectify and they checked and said it was all ok and didn’t know why it hadnt changed but they couldn’t help in store and we had to phone a customer service number.  What’s the point in having a store if they can’t help???So I try this number and guess what twice I had to explain what happened and twice they said “so you want to upgrade?” No you owe me money and the new contract hasnt kicked in.  They then said that a member of billing team would contact me within five days to rectify but a text would confirm the conversation.  Guess what, no contact from billing team and no text.I tried the general chat thing on three app,  had to explain the situation again and their fantastic advice was to go into store and cancel the contract.  When I asked if they could do that they said no.So Three have a store, a chat service, a customer line and billing team all of which cannot help you unless it seems you want a new contract or upgrade.So I’m cancelling my wife’s and kids contracts as they’re all up now and when mine is up this year that’s getting cancelled too. # Very Poor Customer Sevice and support",Positive,0.144747475

Despite promising high speeds, the actual download speed never exceeded 16 megabits, and the upload speed was a mere 3 megabits.During the initial setup, Manager Jamal was friendly and engaging, highlighting the device's advantages and assuring me of a hassle-free experience. He even mentioned a 30-day return policy and advised me to experiment with different locations in my apartment to optimize performance. However, none of these efforts improved the abysmal connection.As I was busy with work commitments, including traveling out of town, I was only able to return the device two days before the end of the trial month. Jamal's demeanor had drastically changed by then. Not only was he no longer cheerful, but he also displayed rudeness by repeatedly emphasizing that I was returning the device just two days before the deadline, as if it was an inconvenience to him.When I questioned the abrupt shift in his behavior, Jamal's response was outright disrespectful, stating that he wasn't even talking to me. Such behavior is unacceptable, especially when discussing a customer's concerns in their presence.In summary, I strongly advise against using Three's services.

Immediate action was taken as we promptly contacted Three to rectify the issue. Despite numerous attempts and ongoing communication with Three over several months, the matter remained unresolved by November. Frustrated by the lack of progress and unable to reach a resolution, we made the decision to cancel our direct debit and terminate our relationship with Three.Throughout this ordeal, our experience with Three's customer service was disheartening. Despite our persistent efforts, we were unable to escalate the matter to a manager, and our requests for callbacks went unanswered. In stark contrast, we have since switched to EE, where we have been met with exceptional customer service.In February 2024, following intervention from the ombudsman, Three acknowledged the issue as a case of mis-selling. While they have refunded charges related to the mysterious number, they continue to expect us to honor the contract for our other lines, despite our decision to leave. This expectation is unreasonable, especially considering the ample time we provided for Three to resolve the situation before taking action.Three replied below: I already have used the link and started a whats app chat on Monday 12th today is 16th and no one has replied: the chat bot asked my name etc then said ""Be aware that there might be a delay in our responses when chatting with us via WhatsApp"" By phone the call handlers cannot pass to a manager and no manager ever calls back.

Rang three to ask for replacement box and was advised I needed to take the box to a three store for a technician to look, and was told of they couldn't fix then the store would provide replacement.Went to store to be told they did not have technicians so I had a wasted journey, nearest store isbab25 minute drive away...advised to ring customer service again which I did and was informed a replacement box would be received within 5 to 7 working days.I rang three on day 5, 6 and 7 to say I had bot received my box, any tracking information or any notifications to say it had been dispatched and was reassured it woukd be delivered by 8pm by DPD on day 7. I argued with them stating they woukd not just turn up without giving a time slot notification, especially since they were also collecting the faulty box, however I kept receiving the same information that the package woukd be delivered later that day. I requested tracking information and was advised this was not possible to provide due to the package being delivered from their consignment office. I also added that I was paying for Internet that I had not even started using and was told all would be sorted so not to worry.Low and behold, day 7 passed and my three replacement did not arrive so I contacted customer service to advise- I was told as a gesture of good will they woukd cancel my contract free of charge and they would then put me through to another department so I could reorder- errmm are you actually serious!  I discussed the payments I had already made an made an upcoming one in 2 days and was told my direct debit woukd be cancelled and I woukd have no further payments taken as long as I returned their box, which they woukd send a jiffy bag out in the post in the next 4 days for. I asked for a postage label instead as thought this would be quicker and I just wanted rid of them; I was told I would received DPD label to my email inbox within the next 2 days- surprise surprise, it has been 3 days and no label has arrived.

If you have any questions, please get in touch.Thanks,The Three TeamAs a Network I can't fault Three have also got 5G Broadband as well as other family on contracts, but their customer services on this matter have been an utter disgrace, it's like they do it on purpose so they can rob you of your money.

This is should of been a simple and straight forward thing, why Three makes so incredibly difficult to do returns I don't know. Lastly having a Customer Service Base in another country where the people have no real sympathy or empathy for your situation, they make you think they care but they don't give a damn, they proved that by the constant lies.UPDATE: Managed to Return the Phone 9 days after Purchase, then after 14 days get an emails saying that if I don't return the phone within the next few days I'll be charged accordingly. 2 days later get email stating phone received, I then get a bill for £37 but this is also minus my £135 upfront cost, from my understanding they've charged me £227 VAT for the phone.

Now how did an uninvited third party get in touch regarding a debt, which in their own words they "".. have no legal right to.."" yet the supposed debtor can't even contact me? Because Three passed personal data unlawfully, and in breach of GDPR, but couldn't use that same information themselves to contact me?I'm at a loss to understand?! For those at Three that was sarcasm, which is a form of wit but half those at Three wouldn't understand that so I thought I'd better explain. Next when I raise a complaint what may be the response? Would you believe it but to quote directly from their email;""We will no longer provide a resolution to your complaint. We have close your complaint case without a resolution and no further action will be taken.""Excellent! Further proof of their customer service, or is that lack of?Now is this a company that you want to have dealings with? I hope, and pray, that ANYONE or everyone reading this gives Three the widest berth possible. Go with any other provider, anyone at all, even if you your handset is a paper cup and your network a piece of string you'll be better off. # Words Fail To Descibe The Inadequacy",Positive,0.013180272
Three,2,GB,1,Terrible Experience with Three & Square Trade,14-Nov-23,684500ae-dea1-43dd-a064-f6de26217a25,"I had lost my phone four months ago on the 14/11/23 and reported this to Three straight away who then suspended the phone/blacklisted this. I had previously taken out insurance with Square Trade as advised by the adviser when i took on the contract as they wouldn't let me have the contracted phone without this.I have had multiple issues with going back and forth for four months to try and resolve this claim for a lost phone, provided evidence they had asked for each time, which they had kept asking for evidence we already provided over and over again. When i had called ST they said all we had to do was respond to the email again, i did this and they misadvised me as to what to do and they are still asking for more information. This has caused that much stress i wanted to cancel all contracts with Three and the insurance company ST. I have not been able to manage my finances due to loss of phone and this has caused great financial difficulty and stress along with not being able to contact anyone for months, affecting my daily life. My internet dongle which i had taken out also through contract with Three was stolen during a house burglary and had not been used since December 2023, they didn't want to know the crime number or take into consideration what had happened and are still billing me for this. I have health conditions and recently suffered a seizure, they did not take any of this into account and did not empathise with my situation. Without anyone being there i wouldn't of been able to call 999 as i have no phone to do so. I do not wish to continue with the contracts and explained this to them today and would like to exit three due to the issues.Due to an outstanding balance which they have billed me for when i have not used either devices for months and explained i cannot pay the exit fee due to no money or phone to access any payments or banking they still offered no help whatsoever. This has got to be the worst experience i have had with a phone company and insurance company who are promoted by three! I would like to warn others to take into consideration all other complaints also and to avoid taking contracts out with Three or dealing with Square Trade. # Terrible Experience with Three & Square Trade",Positive,0.051666667

I was then told I would have wait until the account is fully set up before I can cancel.Then two days later get text tell me that order is cancelled but different order No first advisor tell me this is to replace orginal order no.I then find this is nothing to do with my order but that my mother in law had been a victim of fraud and someone had order an item with Three in her name which is being investigated as the item was arranged with a third party company. As my email was registered on her account that why I got the email of cancellation for the order but three doesnt have any other details.So I have now had to write two letters recorded next day delivery costing me £14.70 one to Glasgow customer complaints and one to head office in Reading in a hope that this mess can be sorted for my own order.If not I plan to sent it back to the return address by DPD myself. More money plus they still have my £60.00 upfront fee.As this seems the only way to get this item returned and the contract cancelled before the 14 days cooling off period.Please be aware that three bill from the moment you order so your first bill is for 35 days but this is all in the small print and told to you so fast you would never know it anyway.All call centre are based in India and they can't transfer you to anyone with in the company apart from other department not individual advisors, I have spoken to about 10 on the telephone and chat online to try to get this issue resolved but still I am no better off than on the first day and have got no ware.Aswell they still go ahead and setup direct debits on your bank account even when you request cancellation. By them making this I have lost out on a new contract mobile, free gifts and money as its costing me money to return and address letters to try and get there mess sorted plus They don't give a dam as your never speak to the same person twice.PLEASE BE AWARE IT NEVER SIMPLE WITH THIS COMPANY.Update 12/02/2024Final got a returns bag or should I say sack it was the size of a dustbin sack.I made sure it was resealed and pack with two bubble wrapped envelopes one inside the other and then had to write a letter to cancellation with a cancellation form and proof of return. Plus after posting back I then get DPD returns label total joke of a company.Check this morning and it final arrived but was held by post office as the company doesn't expect parcel on Saturday/Sunday and I now have to wait for the return of my money and account to be closed. In the meant time I have been getting a lot of scam emails etc. I personal believe that my detail have been sold/ given to thrid parties and this is from the moment I made an order with three. # THREE MOBILE 0 STAR IF I COULD !!!!!!",Positive,0.057443182

The last such one was yesterday, reporting that I had only 20% of my data allowance left when I actually had 46% left.

The email had details to activate manually but the image of QR code was not appearing . I tried to add it manually but It didn't work. I tried many times and wasn't able to do it. Again contacted customer service, they sent me an email but this time I only got email with confirmation details , but didn't get QR code. Just wasted 3,4 hours on chatting and setting up the esim. Worst experience. Other esim providers do it in seconds and three takes more than three hours to send a email and the  QR code doesn't show up. Just annoying to see this.I added esim again manually, and again it said unable to activate the sim. But there was three line showing up in the setting , the line was turned on from setting but there was no signal. Next day I contacted customer service. Their customer representatives don't have any knowledge of this esim and compatible devices. She was repeating the same thing again and again , she was explaining me how to add esim. I told her three times , I already added esim and there is no signal but she didn't see my message properly. I told her to explain this to me properly and only after that, she told me to remove the old esim and add that details again. But the sim details was already expired as it exceeded 24 hrs. I again got email for esim but again, the image of QR code was not showing up , I cleared all the cookies, caches, all the security settings were fine. I even restarted my device but I wasn't able to see the image of QR Code. So I tried entering details manually and I was able to do it after trying for 24 hrs. Such annoying servie.

Decided to check out sim-only plans with popular price comparision sites, only to find an even better deal on offer through Three for the same price I was currenlty paying!  When I called Three to request moving to that better deal I was told I couldn't for all sorts of undisclosed trumped up reasons and then put on hold for ages after wanting to speak to a supervisor.  Eventually I hung up and called again, this time speaking to a different rep in their India based call centre who initially tried to deny access to the deal for yet more undisclosed and trumped up reasons.  I stood my ground, asking why existing customers were being offered plans that were more expensive than those on offer to new customers.  Finally Three relented and offered a 50% discount on one of the deals they'd emailed to me in order to match what I was currently paying.  The behaviour of Three towards existing customers who come to the end of their phone contracts is appalling, giving consumers a very limited choice of more expensive plans and then claiming that other cheaper plans on price comparision websites don't apply.

Three,2,NL,1,Title: Disappointing Experience with Three UK - Caution Advised,06-Feb-24,110fc227-e86d-406e-860a-781fa42c5a08,"I recently had an extremely troubling experience with Three UK that I feel compelled to share. This feedback serves both as a recount of the frustrations I endured and a warning to others considering their services.I initiated my internet service with Three UK with optimism, but that soon waned due to woeful service levels which led me to cancel within the designated cooling-off period. I returned their equipment as directed, and they confirmed its receipt and assured me I was in the clear with zero balance due.This is where the ordeal began.Despite the supposed clean slate, I started receiving automated bills every month. Confused and concerned, I contacted customer service on multiple occasions, and each time they reassured me that the issue had been resolved and that the invoices could be dismissed as errors since my account was closed.Regrettably, the problem persisted. The unwarranted bills kept coming, increasing over time. Now, adding insult to injury, Three UK has disclosed my information to an external collection agency, and this has started to negatively impact my credit score. The agency is now threatening severe actions if I don't settle these erroneous charges.I've submitted all the evidence of Three UK's confirmation of account closure and equipment receipt to the collection agency, and I’m awaiting their response. However, this situation should never have escalated to this point.This has been more than a simple inconvenience; it's been a harrowing episode that has affected my financial standing and caused undue stress. Therefore, I urge everyone to exercise caution with Three UK. Ensure you document all interactions and keep a close eye on your accounts even after cancellation to safeguard against a similar ordeal.This is not simply about poor customer service; it’s an issue that can potentially tarnish your creditworthiness due to no fault of your own. I hope Three UK addresses these systemic issues urgently to prevent other customers from enduring a similar fate. # Title: Disappointing Experience with Three UK - Caution Advised",Negative,-0.031884058

And it is from account which is closed for many years, and I am pretty sure I settled this account properly. I never cancelled the direct debit, so anything I owed, been debited from my account. And, must say, this is not first time when Three messing with my payments, and defaults on my credit file.

I told him I wanted a 12m plan at £18 per month. He said that offer is only for a new number and the best he could do for me on a 12m plan would be £27 per month! I said no, he then came back with £22 per month! At this point I read out the letter I had in front of me that gave me an option of 12m @ £18 per month.

I’ve been a customer for over 10 years and the last 3 years have never been so disappointing when dealing with this company. Not only did you take £3000 out my account “by accident” during lockdown, I have been called a liar, I have been cut off around 7/8 times due to poor, untrained staff, I’ve spent a total of 8 hours in the last 2 months on live chats to get absolutely no help. On the 30th of Jan I had an instalment of £53.01 to be paid. This was paid within that day. I then receive a text message the next day to say that I haven’t paid it. Spent two hours on a live chat today with 3 different service advisors (one stating to be the manager called Ophelia) to be told that I haven’t paid it and my services have now been cut off. I have to pay the remaining of my payment plan up front to keep my phone contract. Which I couldn’t do and has now  resulted in me losing work this morning as i could not use my phone and to finally end my phone contract with three. I have to say as frustrating as this has been, the stress this has caused me over the years is ridiculous. I have currently contacted the ombudsman on their website as I have made 3 complaints in the last 6 months and not heard 1 thing back which has warranted me to get extra help now and take further action. I will say to anyone now, three outsources their customer service so when you contact them it’s being sent to the other side of the world to advisors that really don’t give two hoots about you or about the company.

I cancelled immediately and stopped the DD.  They then sent me a bill for the required one month's notice period but based the charge on the new contract price - the one I did not agree to.  I sent them a month's cancellation fee based on the contract I had, which they simply offset against the bill they had sent and demanded the difference.  I wrote to them on three occasions informing them of their error and the reasony for my cancellation.  The never replied to any of them, and continued to send 'reminders' and demands.  Eventually they went quiet.  A year later, I received a letter from a debt recovery agency informing me they had purchased the 'debt' from Three.  After a friendly dialogue with them, they accepted there was no debt to recover - something Three could have done at the start.  Even assuming Three's attempt to supplant the new contract on me was inadvertant - and not a deliberate attempt to stiff me - their behaviour has been appalling.  It begs the question; how many times have they got away with it?Response to Three's reply:Thanks for the reply, but that does not explain why I was put on a new contract without my consent. It also doesn't explain why you didn't respond to my letters, nor does it explain why you pursued me for a 'debt' that never existed.  You obviously read all your on here.

Canceled my contract within the 14 days cooling off period and was told I'd recieve a returns bag and I'd have my initial payment sent back to me once the device had been received. I never received a bag so I called them back up. They told me not to worry its on its way. Few weeks later still no bag called them again they said they have received the device already despite the device being sat on my desk as I was talking to them. They said they would send another bag. This time I finally got it however now my bill that I was told not to worry about was now overdue. I mentioned this on another call and they said don't worry ignore the bills as they will stop once device had been returned. At this point I started getting contact attempts from a debt collection agency so I imidiatly called back asking why they had sent debt collectors after me despite telling me not to worry about the bill. I also said I do not want this affecting my credit report as im in the process of shopping for a house. They said don't worry this will not happen. I got an email saying the device had been returned and the email stated I'd get my refund within seven days. I received this email on 03/01/24 I still haven't received this refund. Recently I placed an offer on a house and applied for a mortgage. Guess what... my credit report had missing/late payments from three... they previously told me this would not happen. I rang them up and they said we will get this sorted and it would be removed on the next update (01/02/24) still this has not been updated. So now I'm unable to get a mortgage, they owe me money, and debt collectors are still chasing me. All because they are Incapable of completing simple tasks. This is a breach of contract.

The only way to beat the system is to pose as a new customer looking to take out a contract... then start complaining as soon as you're connected to an actual person. Even then it took three attempts to arrange the return (finally sorted by the complaints team) and despite the supposed money-back-guarantee I've now received an extra bill on top of what I'd already paid. Couldn't be botheed to waste hours more chasing that up so I've just raised another complaint by email - which I'm not expecting a response to.So: probably the worst customer experience I've ever had.  EDIT:  Hey Jonathan, and thanks for your (not very helpful) reply. I am comforted to find that I did have a Three number all along. You should tell your customer advisers that: they didn't seem to know either. They certainly couldn't find it anywhere. I would love to discuss the matter further - but without that mythical number... I can't get through to anyone. Incidentally, I've also had a response to my latest complaint. Asking me to get in touch... with the same contact details you supplied. Which I can't do, because without the mythical number... well you know the rest.  So... here's an idea: Get a real person to get in contact with ME. You have the deets. # Recently ordered the Home Broadband…",Positive,0.066218839

I asked if it would be possible to go into the Store to finish the order to collect the phone that way.

The store is empty and I sit down with an advisor where I explain the situation, she says OK and we sit for 10min+ in silence whilst she looks through the details, she then notes that an order is active on the system but she would need to cancel it to continue in store. She found a way to cancel the order and then proceeded to offer me early termination costs and upfront fees, I then AGAIN mentioned the email I had for a FREE upgrade with NO upfront cost and showed her the email on my phone. The advisor then told me this was ONLINE only and that she could not help me until my upgrade date. #Live Chat attempt #3 - I try to quickly explain AGAIN that I have an email for the above detail on a new deal and then am told this is only available on the S24 and this promotion is over, I am at the end of my patience at this point and just want to take up the offer I was presented with, not that I asked for!! I suspect this person was extremely sarcastic and used the words ""we wouldn't want to lose a fantastic customer like you"" after I questioned the processes within the company, why do I need to challenge you on your offers, how is that even happening? - eventually, get to the contract talks again, pick the phone colour and the advisor makes multiple mistakes by changing the contract duration, and mistyping the data allowances, I tell the person I am unable to continue and close the chat.

This was accepted and was told my services will be resumed and to re start my phone. I did this and it only got worse, it then came up saying no service and no network and could no longer even receive calls or texts which was the opposite of which they said they would do. I spoke to someone else who told me it would be 2 hours so I waited but still nothing. Hours and hours later I contacted three again and this person then told me something completely different and seemed clueless. No one could help me get my service back / network available or explain why it’s not working as they all confirmed my services had been re activated. So I tried to work it out myself watching videos etc but literally nothing worked. Three are literally clueless and so unhelpful, none of them had a clue and just wasted most of the live chat thanking me for waiting and asking how I am and to ask for my details which I have provided a million times already.

Years ago I made the mistake of being locked into a contract with Three for 2 years.

Handset only and a SIM card I'm not likely to use. It would be impressive for them to cock this up, I thought.Two days later they arrived by courier..and it was the wrong phone.3 days of calls and online chats got me absolutely no where. I was passed from the PAYG team to the Pay Monthly team. Of the 10 people I spoke to, no one could decide who's issue at Three it was to resolve. The only answer I kept getting was 'you'll need to visit your local Three store', despite it being an online order, and despite the Consumer Right Acts confirming that they have to resolve an incorrectly shipped item without any inconvenience to me. apparently Consumer Rights doesn't feature in Three Customer Support (loose term) training.When I finally got the time to inconveniently visit the store in late December, I was told immediately 'we can't help you, as this is an online order'.Well done Three, you've smashed this customer service game out the park. Utterly useless.The saving grace was the store manager who supported me in raising a formal complaint. But sadly here we are, nearly 4 weeks after that complaint was raised, and I STILL do not have a resolution from Three. I am STILL in posession of the incorrect phone, and STILL have no sign of how this is going to be solved. Frankly I just want my money back.The 'complaints' team at Three call me twice a week to tell me they need more time, as they have not yet been able to identify what went wrong.Why on earth I need to know what went wrong, I don't know.

When trying to cancel, I was given marketing pitches about upgrading and trying different products which is annoying and stupid - especially when the first product does not work well (!). Then, after having agreed a contract end date, I was sent a threatening email that I would be charged £105 if I didn't send the device back to Three by a certain date. I had to argue with the live chat agent that this date was wrong and not what had been agreed to in the previous chat by sending them quotes of what I had been told, even though I sent a transcript of the chat so he could have read this for himself. It is not the staff's fault as they have occasionally been helpful and are always polite but forcing them to do sales pitches all the time and not training them properly to deal with problems leads to awful customer service.

The service no longer works in my postcode due to them working on ""network improvements"". I therefore decided to end the contract (years beyond the minimum contractual period). I found it nearly impossible to find a way of doing this online, logged into my account. There are also no options available to cancel a contract when you call their help line. I eventually raised a cancellation request through their chat function. To ensure they had actually cancelled the contract I also cancelled my direct debit. I had been promised confirmation of cancellation, when this hadn't arrived a couple of days later I phoned and chose the new contract/upgrade option and from there was passed to another team to confirm cancellation. They had no records of cancellation, so I made another attempt. They also said that if anything was owed I would be emailed an invoice. 7 months later I have been approached by a debt collection agency. I have received no confirmations nor invoices from Three. In total I estimate that I have spent the best part of a day on the phone and using their chat bot to cancel the contract. Their system is designed to make it virtually impossible to leave the service. Don't even think about using this company, their network coverage is really bad, their systems are deliberately designed to make changing provider a herculean task. They hold their customers in contempt and it's all about wringing the last few pennies out of an underinvested network.To comment on Three's response below - Yes I gave reference numbers for previous chats and I noted the time of all the calls. That was of absolutely no interest to Three and didn't elicit any action.

I quoted the account number on the letter to find there was another SIM only account in my name that I had no knowledge of!

I told them it was fraud, they said they'd investigate it and get back to me, I just received an email to say my query had been dealt with. So I got in contact to find out whether they'd actually dealt with it or not - they determined that it was me who took out the contract!

They said they would cancel it within 5 days because my area had bad service (they confirmed this from there end). I asked to be given time to find a replacement. When I rang back 3-5 days later, then made me go through the whole system again to cancel. They tried to pretend that the problem was fixed. Eventually they agreed to cancelling and I returned the hub. I got no confirmation of them receiving it or a final bill. They then charged me at the end of May for the month. I contacted them and got no reply. I cancelled my direct debit and they rang me saying I owed them money!

Three,15,GB,1,STAY AWAY AND AVOID,15-Jan-24,53723f12-0d5a-4744-b11a-0fffe61dddbf,Writing on behalf of my step daughter. She called up to get broadband fitted in her apartment with Three. Due to living on the 9th floor she needs the sim version broadband. She calls up and speaks to someone and gets the order. That’s when the issues started. First of all she informed the sales person that she wouldn’t be home on the day as she was working and needed to have the router delivered to the building office for her to collect later. This couldn’t be done for god knows how many reasons. Complaint passed to manager and against told this couldn’t be done. So we ( her parents) have gone to collect at time of delivery. But delivery person didn’t deliver as it was placed in the office like we originally asked and was told it couldn’t be. Then the router doesn’t work. Got told to wait 24 hours for connection. So she did. Then still not working. So calls up again and told the sim wasn’t turned on at there end. So wait another 24 hours. Guess what. Still not working. So not been told wait 72 hours….It’s still not on. And complaints seem to fall on deaf ears. God only knows what it will be like if it actually goes live. It I don’t hold out much hope. This company is hands down the worst company I have ever had to deal with. The customer service is shocking and they dont know what they are doing. Apologies don’t cut it when the person who needs the router is working from home and requires internet.

Three,10,GB,1,WARNING Customer Fraud at Three!!!,06-Jan-24,16a6ac30-9507-4665-8c65-14090b448646,"FRAUD that 3 are actively facilitating in. Package delivered via DPD to an unsuspecting person - not expecting anything? 5 minutes later another person knocks at the door claiming it is an error and takes it back. 29th Dec 24  I was at work and the neighbours husband took a package and then another person knocked again asking for it back and his wife handed the package over. She text me but i was confused as not expecting anything. Normally, you get text message ref a delivery but as this is a SCAM that message goes the scammer who took sets up the collection. I then came home and the DPD card was on the mat advising of a delivery???? On 4th Jan my neighbour advises me that a package arrived for his wife via DPD and he accepted it. A few minutes later another person askes for it back as an error. He refused as a it was a different operative with no ID. My neighbour said they were reporting it to the police and just gave me the heads up as what had happened with the package they accepted and handed back for me the week previous :- 5th Jan, I arrived home to find a Direct Debit Mandate letter from Three? A Company I have no connection with. The letter advised me of a direct debit with my name and address but not my account or sort code? A fake account. I reported this to action fraud that evening as I had called Three but they were useless. It has become apparent that Three acted without any due diligence and facilitated in a fraud resulting in a fraudster taking out a £1135 loan using a fake bank account. My name and address was used but someone else's account and sort code to obtain finance. Furthermore when the credit check would have been done the Bank account used will show as a 'mismatch' to my name and address. But this was overwritten  and the credit agreement completed, knowing the account was not valid. One has to wonder if an employee of Three is complicit in this fraud or the Company turn a blind eye to conduct  get a sale? The bank in question have confirmed I have no account with them and the account belongs to another individual. My Credit score shows this Loan and has my score has been impacted. BE WARNED!!! and be careful. As for Three this is a statement on their site....... 'A dedicated fraud team to manage customer concerns. We also use a SOPHISTICTED suite of systems to monitor and mitigate fraudulent activity' My horrendous situation proves otherwise. My incident has been reported to the police, Action Fraud, Three have all these ref no's. My next step shall be the Ombudsman. So Three tell me, where is the fraud team now and why has nobody has contacted me. Utterly disgraceful. Update today 18th Jan 24-  I have just called Three for an update and according to their CS team they have a complaint but NO DETAILS. I sat in front of the Manager at Tunbridge Wells store when he called them and gave them all the details. Then they asked me for information again. However, they did not take my crime ref no's for the Police or Action fraud. The operative took basic personal details and then advised me he had to read me a statement, here it is, 'your information will be passed to our customer service team who will investigate, You may or may not receive a call but you will get a letter with a summary of what happened within 14 days. NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!! At some point the Three will be trying to take a DD debit from that account no. The bank will refuse and then the finance provider will use my NAME & ADDRESS for the money!!!Update Sunday 21/1/24 I called in to a 3 Store in Kent on Saturday and gave in the customer account no on the direct debit they sent me for this fraudulent account. The assistant advised me the account had been set up on line. Also, this is the third 3 store I have been in and the staff are all aware of this type of fraud in their business.

I have their home broadband and spent no less than 18 hours online to their support to try to get it working right (I kept dropping speeds and losing connection). Their support just seemed to be doing a combination of blaming me/my devices, and scatter gun trial and error and hoping for the best. In the end I thought the problem might be my SIM or my phone number so I cancelled the order and ordered a new one! Which had the same issues!It was only when I found an amazing online forum of helpful engineers that I was able to get it running correctly - these people with no professional connection to 3 knew all sorts of things about the three network and routers that three tech support didn't have a clue about! When I phoned to cancel the first router/account, well within the cooling off period, by default they tried to charge me a cancellation fee. I had to be pretty forceful to get them to drop it. And even after I cancelled the first account, they failed to send me the delivery label to return the router. SO I had to make a second call - and that took a whopping 37 minutes - just to get them to promise to resend the delivery label.

I’ve been robbed, but I’ve wasted enough of my time trying to get this back and it’s not worth going to the ombudsman and taking up their time over £20.Glad to be rid of this terrible company and I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone.Everybody makes mistakes, but I’ve been lied to in every single interaction with customer services and the complaints team, it’s laughable!Totally understand the company’s low score on here.Edit after response from company:Thank you but I have no desire for any further interaction with anybody from the complaints team. # Dishonest customer service and complaints team",Negative,-0.196258503

After an atrocious service from O2 for the past year, just could not get anything resolved with O2 customer services, I transferred over to Three. From the minute I contacted customer services at Three to ask a few questions before I changed, the response and answers from them were to the point and accurate, plus it was helpful I got someone from an English call centre. What followed I could not believe, the sim arrived within a couple of days, my number was Ported within 48 hours, then within a couple of days more I could access everything on their website. What was important to me was having the facility of downloading my bill each month online. I could do this immediately on them registering my first bill. This was not possible even after a year with O2. Personally and I have nothing to do with Three, this is just from my experience to date, I cannot fault them and would give Three 10 out of 10.

I finally finished my final contract and left after 11 years. This network has gone to the absolute dogs. Used to be good, but now everything is done on a shoestring and they only seek to extract much cash out of you as possible. Issues are: - Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING is now outsourced. You HAVE to go through their phone customer support for anything useful, which is outsourced and they don't understand what you're saying half the time. If you go into the store they will merely try to tell you to ring the phone support.- They are outrageously expensive, and will charge you like crazy for every little thing. The phone support don't really understand half the time why you've been charged so much, but will just tell you to pay it anyway. - Constantly trying to sell more to you. You ring up because you need help understanding your extremely expensive bill - well they won't understand how to help you with that, but they'll certainly understand how to try to get you to take on a second contract (for no reason whatsoever). You'll say ""Oh I don't need another phone"", and they'll try to convince you that you do. WTH? - They love to ruin your credit score. If you are querying why a bill is so expensive, they will tell you to wait to pay until they investigate why it is so much. You ask ""will you ruin my credit score"" and they'll tell you no. They will then proceed to ruin it, and when you query this, they'll just say ""Oh that person told you wrong, woops nothing we can do"".- They don't do what they say they will do. Sometimes you'll ring up and they'll say ""I'll call you back after we investigate"". They absolutely won't. - When staff can understand you, they don't know what they're doing anyway. You'll receive mixed messages, being told one thing by one support team member, and something else by another. This is everything off the top of my head.

I understand they couldn't  discuss her details with me but they should have a procedure in place to escalate possible ID theft and fraud.So 3 replied and directed me back to their hopeless customer service page, when the A* response would have been a direct email address or phone number for their fraud team.

They were good value, with consistent signal/service, and the absolute best roaming in the business. I couldn't have recommended them more... years ago.Now, Three seem to be doing everything they can to put themselves out of business. From something as insignificant as a bizarre choice of colour scheme change (seriously, a pink-to-white gradient? It's extremely ugly), to a recent app overhaul that has rendered their service sluggish, confusing, and borderline unusable for many customers, it's as if Three are reading directly from the playbook of how to fail in record time. Their customer service, while it has improved, is still pretty poor, and their roaming is worse than ever, but by far the worst thing about Three now is the technical stuff - which can lead to you getting completely ripped off, like what happened to me.Just last month, I attempted to top up my pay-as-you-go SIM for roaming abroad. I wanted to put just £10 on to see me through the week. Historically, this has been a very painless and cost-effective way of using my phone abroad. However, this time, I got an error stating that my attempt to pay for my top up had been unsuccessful (and I got a very weird error message saying ""Somethig went wrong in the procces."" [sic].) I tried again, but I got the same error. I realised that trying to top up *within* the app wasn't going to work, so I got a top up from a third-party site. This final, 3rd £10 top up worked just fine. However, moments later, I got 2 texts from Three stating that they had manually paid in the two £10 top ups that had failed. Obviously, I didn't want this additional £20 credit, but it had been taken out of my bank account anyway. On top of that, topping up my phone failed to activate a ""data pack"" for roaming, which is needed - otherwise, using minutes, texts or data will gobble up your credit in record time, which is what happened. There was never a point where I had to manually activate a so-called ""data pack"", and I've never had to do this in the past. It just didn't work this time, so in less than 24 hours, the £30 credit (£20 of which was unwanted) got devoured. I have had to fight tooth and nail for the last 30 days to get Three to refund me, but the best they could do is put £20 back on my phone's credit, which is useless to me.On top of the above, their website and their app both provide confusing layouts, and are rife with bizarre typing and grammatical errors. The website's code often shows briefly before the site itself loads, and it's awkward trying to get help with legitimate issues with your account.Avoid Three at all costs. Let them wallow in the consequences of their own awful decisions, and choose another provider - *anyone* else. # How the mighty have fallen. Score: Three/100.",Positive,0.066369048

When they 'redesigned' their app it became impossible to register for both and manage both accounts with a single email address. In other words if you more than one phone/ SIM with 3 you need a different email address for each one to be able to manage the cards/ accounts on the app. This is beyond ridiculous. Customer service say the company is aware of the fault and trying to correct it. It might have been better not to launch the new app until it actually worked. Muppets.The response from Three is disingenuous and plain wrong. Customer services were adamant on two occasions that this cannot be done. So either 'Jonathan' needs to get his facts straight or everyone in customer services has to be told that there is a solution to what they openly say is a widespread complaint.

Three,1,GB,1,Disrespectful customer service reps,11-Dec-23,dffae105-d387-4d35-bf2d-643324f7ac69,"After being with Three for over a decade, I left this year. For me it was the experience of trying to manage my account online that prompted it. A couple of examples: buying a data passport while abroad worked for a few days and then suddenly the same link brought me to a completely unrelated page on their website and I was unable to find where I could purchase a new one, even searching for it. Similarly, the 'Contact Us' page is woefully circular, which is unforgivable for such a crucial element. Step 1: Tell us why you want to contact us, Step 2: For reason x? Great, get in touch with us via our 'Contact Us' page, Step 3: see Step 1 above. I recommend the company spend some time mapping and then revising the user journey's associated with their website.The above would have warranted a three, maybe 2 star at worst. The one star is because a couple of days after transferring my number to a competitor I received a call from a Three sales rep, offering me a deal. I explained that I have left three because I wasn't happy with the service. He asked me why, and after getting three seconds in to my quite polite explanation, he hung up on me. Personally, I would always try to find a way to give feedback directly to a company as I appreciate the difficulties of management. If they do not want the feedback that really is their loss and would make me lament the lack of cohesion between front-line staff and the strategic direction of management, but ultimately it is their loss and would not make me angry. However, there is no excuse for eliciting the feedback directly from a customer and then treating that customer with disrespect. Oh, and just incase anyone was thinking that maybe it was a mistake, a one off, I received another call the next day from a different sales rep offering me the same deal and when I told him that I wasn't interested and that his colleague had hung up on me, he asked me why, and then when I said I don't know, he said goodbye and ended the call. Not quite as bad as being hung up on in the middle of a sentence but no apology offered on behalf of the company, and its enough to convince me that the poor customer service is a systemic problem, and was enough to prompt me to post a public.I would recommend the company seek ways to help their front-line staff internalise responsibility for the strategic outcomes of the company and sense of ownership over the brand.

So I opted to set the auto renew up and has failed in the same way again.This company's customer services gets worse each month, instead of finding the root cause of issues and fixing it long term they bait and switch for another month and it just wastes time. Its worth going with a more competent provider.Edit: While this time round the second person I spoke to was more helpful (the first person was stuck in sales mode). I am told each time that issue has been passed on to a technical team and that does not seem to result in change. Instead of having to go through the webchat, since I filled in the optional fields in my you can locate my account.

At the end of our conversation I decided to stay with Three, and renew my SIM only contract, and purchase the Samsung S23 Ultra, which cost £1253!At the point of payment I noticed the amount I was being charged was £1278. When I queried it was explained that in addition to the new contract amount plus the cost of the phone, I was also being charged £10 for a Pay As You Go SIM as this was included in the offer!I looked at the salesperson, waiting for the penny to drop. When it didn't, I asked why on earth I would want to pay for something that I would not be using and did not need as I had just renewed my SIM only contract and was therefore keeping my existing SIM.He replied that there was nothing he could do as this was part of the deal!!!I have just called Three customer services to resolve this issue and all I can say is that for a COMMUNICATIONS company, you are dreadful at exactly that.The automated service is convoluted and LOOOOOONG. You have a main option menu that, depending on the button you press, leads to ANOTHER sub menu with at least 3 options and this too will inevitably lead to ANOTHER sub menu!Not to mention the endless DRIVEL that is spoken in between the choosing of options and passing from one menu to another sub menu and during your option selection! All this is costing ME money not to mention wasting MY precious time!At the end of all these options I was finally connected to an agent, who most definitely was not British! I explained the situation and then ended up explaining it again and then repeating it to confirm!REALLY? Are your agents not trained in the art of LISTENING?I was then put on hold for 1 minute before the agent returned to confirm a £10 credit would be placed on my account. The whole exercise took at least 10 minutes from beginning to end, and all to get a refund for £10 that I should NOT have been charged for in the first instance! Great way to start the new year - NOT!At no point did he actually get the point which is WHY offer a £10 Pay As You Go SIM with a product that CANNOT be removed at point of purchase, if the customer ALREADY has an existing SIM and number they wish to use instead?For crying out loud THREE, get your bloody act together.

The network quality has consistently been abysmal, with frequent disruptions and poor signal strength. Despite having a spending cap of zero in place, I have been overcharged on numerous occasions, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied.Adding to the frustration, I opted for a data passport for my holidays to Europe, only to find myself without any network coverage despite paying for the service. This not only wasted my money but also left me stranded without essential connectivity.The final blow came when I decided to terminate my contract due to these persistent issues. Despite being assured that my final bill would be reduced due to the hardships I endured, I was shocked to discover that I was charged the full amount and even faced additional charges. The customer service's lack of transparency and failure to honor their commitments further exacerbated my dissatisfaction.In summary, my years with Three have been marked by terrible network quality, overcharging, and unfulfilled promises.

There must be some loophole as to how they are getting away with it but it shouldn't be legal. They promise three months for free but what they don't tell you before you sign up is that it doesn't include access to the internet. After four weeks of calling and asking them to give me access to internet, them sending out three replacement sims and two replacement boxes, I decided to cancel. Oh and also can you believe that if you go into a store for help, they actually tell you to your face that they are unable to help you AT ALL, as originally your purchase was made over the phone or online? What are the stores for, merely advertising? After returning their product, they then tell you that even though you sent it within the time required and can provide the tracking number, sending it via the mode THEY requested, they are still going to charge you £105 for a product that never worked. How can it be worth that much. How do the commissions work, how much does that staff member receive when Three are able to charge me? It must be a significant amount because he was determined to break the law.  I had to argue for about an hour and the manager finally confirmed I would not be charged after letting him know there is such a thing as consumer rights.

The customer service staff have as much use as a chocolate teapot and the service is questionable at best. Strap your seatbelts and prepare for this rollercoaster. My 2 year contract was up and I was advised via email that if I chose to switch to another provider I would not need to give notice. However, upon advising three that I would like to leave they advised me that I had to give 30 days notice since I didn’t want to keep my number, they would send out my final bill and proceeded to send me a set of vague terms and conditions to agree to. As someone that is both legally trained and not a complete moron, I didn’t accept the terms and conditions as the amount of my final bill was not clarified after asking and stating explicitly that I did not want to pay another £82.99 for a service I did not need. The customer service agent had the extensive vocabulary of a parrot repeating phrases it’s heard and clearly couldn’t give a flying fart about customers and decided to cancel my account and service which would end in 30 days time despite the fact I did not accept the terms and conditions which makes my acceptance (or lack of) of the terms and conditions not legally binding.At this point I was unaware of PAC and STAC codes. However, after discovering STAC codes I got into contact with my new provider who were seemingly able to stop my contract and service with three within a few days. It’s almost as though Three either intentionally do not tell their customers or are completely unaware of STAC codes.

Three,20,GB,1,"Worst Customer Service in the world, bar none!!!!",05-Dec-23,0675418b-09e8-44da-8ec9-bfa08cb1cad5,"I have had a Sim only contract and a broadband contract with Three  for between 3 and 4 years. When the first contract was ending, just over 12 months ago, I visited the Three store at Meadowhall Sheffield with a view to terminating the contract, mainly due to the very poor signal that I was receiving at my address. The internet was very sketchy and regarding the phone signal, if I answer the phone in my home in any place other than the far corner of the main bedroom, the call would disconnect / cut off. Anyway I was given all the sales patter about 5G and an offer that I couldn't refuse and I signed a new contract. Incidentally, 12 months on, the internet and phone situation are exactly as poor as ever.One thing that I always always always ask when setting up new contracts, is do I need to do anything at the bank. On every occasion, regardless of which provider I have been with, they always say no. No you do not need to do anything. The old contract billing will stop and the new one will automatically take over. This is always the answer, but I still ask that question each time. I specifically remember the latest occasion when this happend. I remember the female agent who was serving me. I remember the desk that we sat at in the store. I remember which chair she sat on and which chair I sat on. This is all very clear in my memory and as I said, the answer was, no you don't need to do anything.Any way, cutting a long story short. I never check my bank statements. I routinely save them all, but never look at them. I trust everyone to do what they are supposed to do. My banking activity is very boring. The statements are very repetitive with the same 4 direct debits leaving my account each month. Landlord, Council Tax, Water and Three. Or so I thought!!!Something happend at a high street shop with a new employee getting into a pickle whilst trying to operate the credit card machine and I was charge twice. The manager rectified this and instigated a refund of one of the payments. This payment should land back into my bank within 3 to 5 days. This was something new and I needed to now check my next statement to confirm this return. Whilst doing this, I just happend to glance at my other direct debits and spotted that something was wrong with the Three one. Upon investigation, I discovered that instead of 2 Three direct debits leaving my account, there were actually 4 ( 2 current ones and 2 from the previous contracts ) and I also discovered that this had been going on for 12 months. I had been overcharged by approximately £300.I know from previous experience and it is exactly the same now, that Three customer service is the worst in the world, ever. Slightly worse than British gas. There's no coincidence that they both penny pinch by using cheap labour in India. Well you get what you pay for and as i said, customer service is painfully shocking and is a very traumatic experience. 9 lengthy phone calls to 333 India speaking to Vajed, Sharuch, Asad and several others, I made zero progress. A complaint was logged but i am still no nearer to a refund. Despite the seriousness of this complaint, they never phone you back. Hours I have spent phoning this unfit for purpose 333 number. They all apologise many times on behalf of Three but do absolutely nothing.Out of desperation I wrote a letter to Three Customer complaints in Glasgow. I have also cancelled all four Three direct debits and they will remain cancelled until someone owns this problem and returns all my money.As a result of cancelling all payments, I did receive a call from India, where I was insultingly  offered £100. I refused this and am waiting for someone to contact me again with the offer of a full refund, plus bank interest and a good will gesture to cover and compensate for my time, inconvenience and distress. I was advised by my bank to give Three 14 days in which to return my money. If this is not going to happen, then I require a deadlock letter, so that I can begin going down the Ombudsman route.Please do not give a diplomatic response to to this asking me to phone 333. It doesnt work. The Customer service is shocking and unfit for purpose. I will never phone that number again.Someone needs to either phone me to offer a full refund, or send me a deadlock letter so that I can contact the Ombudsman.All direct debit payments will remain cancelled until something is done.Responder remember - No more 333!!!!, No more india!!!! # Worst Customer Service in the world, bar none!!!!",Negative,-0.089038775

But they continue to hound me with various debt amounts. Received a letter in the post the other day asking for money owed which went onto saying if the bill isn't paid they would pass it onto a debt collection company and my credit history would be harmed.

Never again.The router has to be restarted five or six times a day - not fun when you work from home - and a dozen calls with technical support have achieved nothing. Likewise, factory resets achieve nothing. No offer of a replacement, and seemingly no interest while I'm a captive of the contract. Worse yet, in the first month of having that broadband, it was incredibly fast. 300mbit, easily. At this point I struggle for 10mbit and upload speeds are so poor I can barely have a video call, even with nobody else in the house. It is oversold and underprovisioned.To top it all off, I'm constantly challenged with captchas and some services don't recognise that I'm even in the UK. This may be something Three have limited capacity to fix, but is still a deep irritation.On balance, next time I'm going for 4G broadband with a different provider who doesn't use Three's network.

Three,2,GB,1,So I was with Three for 2 phone…,21-Dec-23,746c0c27-8afe-4ddc-b041-6aa2bf6ff576,So I was with Three for 2 phone contracts. My main reason for moving to them is that picked up the Razer phone that as a gamer I was interested in trying out. I stayed with Three after that contract came to an end. I upgraded to a new phone the Samsung S20 Ultra. Everything was great until I came to LEAVE THREE. I moved over to EE. The change over went smoothly or so I thought. I got my pat code to take my number with me and made the move cancelling my contract with Three at the end of that contract. I thought everything was done until I went through my bank account later and noticed THREE had continued to charge me on a lower rate of around £15 a month. When I contacted Three to resolve this I came to blockers everywhere. The number linked to the account I never owned and there seemed to now be no email linked to the account. They constantly said they would send a code to the number even though I stated I never had access to it. I could however confirm account and sort code with them BUT this wasn't good enough proof that I was the one they where scamming. I had to visit a store to add a email to the account. This was just to even start the process of cancelling the account never mind trying to recover the charges. After doing all this they decided that I would have to pay 2 more payments while they cancelled the account. I contacted the bank to block these obviously. They did however open an enquiry which I thought might of been some progress. I received 2 emails to say that the query had been closed with 0 feedback. After contacting them both times they had come to the outcome that this was not an error and it was my fault. They did however offer me a £20 credit on any Three active number I have even though I'm no longer a customer which is clearly great.I'm guessing this will never get resolved and I have just lost the money they took.

From that month onwards my WiFi calling option was the only thing that kept both of my SIM cards going on my DualSIM Samsung S22. After going through months of troubleshooting, receiving unfulfilled promises and minor discounts to appease me...I decided to end both lines in October.  Firstly operators are difficult to deal with,  hard to understand,  and happy to pass you on to someoneelse meaning you have to start the process of explaining all over again.  Multiple times during troubleshooting I was cut off (operators never call back) so you have to go through an hour of holding to get back to a new person,  to then commence the process anew. Finally after days/ weeks I managed to prove I was without signal and not due to any issue i could rectify on my end.  I was given a 60% early termination fee reduction due to it not being my fault and having 12 months left on contract. Other line only had 6 months and was a cheaper SIM only deal so was waived completely.  A month later after moving both numbers to more reliable companies I received a bill for the amount that was waived.  I was then told no notes regarding this fee waiver had been made from the phone call,  and to move forward with this claim ""I must provide  Three with proof"" (proof of a phone call ....idiocy...ha!) After refusing to pay either of the termination fees and threatening to cancel my families lines that we pay for (3 more in total) I was finally told I won't have to pay this as I WAS given early fee waiver.  I feel the departments within their customer service team do not corresponds with each other and any problem requires starting afresh with each call/enquiry. The 1hour plus chat I had with an operator today reminded me of how lucky I am to have left this company.  My family are experiencing complete signal loss more and more often at recent times so we are looking to cancel those lines ASAP also.

After I tried saying no I wanted to just check for Internet deals. The adviser tried to get pac codes behind my back.

Tried three times to call customer service to make a complaint and been told the complaints team are busy each time. They like to con disabled people. The adviser and the manager went out the back and had a chat. And made up a plan to not only keep me in contract and screw me over even more but to stick up for each other. The manager is a liar and again they both take advantage of disabled people by making them belive and pressure them into things. How did they both even get jobs but for one to be a manager with that attitude. As the manager messed about when I took the items back, he left me without a sim but didn't care at all, there was massive lies told, customer service don't listen, they arrange a call back so you advices them you dont have the 3 sims. They yet still call them sims. Have mentioned this many times don't have the sims and yet they still call them , you get told to call back as complaints are busy.

Over the years the costs have slowly crept up to the point I was paying £33 for 4GB of data each month. I contacted Three to ask for a better deal and they advised me that they would not offer another PAYG contract (despite these being available to new customers) and insisted I needed to move to a 24 month plan. I explained I did not want to do this because none of their 24 month plans included data roaming. The agent on the chat told me not to worry and that he would include 56 days roaming on the package I was subscribing to. No sooner had I signed up to the contact he advised me he had made a mistake, and that the data roaming was not available unless I agreed to pay another £50. Needless to say I immediately asked to cancel the contract as it was not what I had agreed to, and then the problems started. I was transferred to another department, who after 2 hours had still not cancelled it. The agent eventually told me to come back tomorrow. I had to insist multiple times I wanted to cancel and kept being told it was not possible.

For 30 minutes, the customer service representative tried to convince me not to cancel before I finally got fed up and started raising my voice. The reason I left three was because I was moving to a new country. They read out the terms and conditions and I did not ask for a PAC code as I dont need one as I was moving countries. Little did I know they kept charging my UK bank account which I no longer check as I had moved countries and had moved all money out of my account, I had only left enough money left in the bank account to fully close out the contract, which I agreed would take 30 days from the cancellation date to occur. 6 months later I get an email from the debt collectors requesting for 4 months of services (which I didnt use as my account was agreed to be cancelled). I called three mobile and they said they have no records of the initial call to cancel which at this point I GOT MAD, because how could you forget a 30minute phone call where you cancel the contract!?

HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE FED UP WITH THREE!EVEN ANOTHER UPDATE: I am no longer a THREE customer but have this week been contacted 4 times already about a refund that was apparently made against my (now closed) account and the others are about an outstanding balance I have apparently incurred since leaving them. I keep going back to the Executive Team. They keep ignoring the issue. FURTHER UPDATE: THREE's comments here are an example of their complete lack of customer care. My son passing away has nothing to do with my complaint - THREE's failures are the issue. They seem to have completely missed how offensive it was to have their well-being team reach out to me unsolicited as someone who is vulnerable or disabled when I never alluded to being in either of those categories. Quite clearly, THREE will deflect rather that deal with the actual issues i.e. THEIR TERRIBLE, OFFENSIVE AND INSULTING CUSTOMER SERVICE.THREE continue to harass me with constant text messages most of which are trying to entice me to stay. I've told them to stop messaging me. They refused! So every time I got one of these, I messaged their executive team. They responded by having Sean from their well-being team who deals with vulnerable and disabled customers get in touch to see how he could help. Apparently, the problem can't possibly be Three's customer service - it must be something wrong with me.UPDATE: Three called back to try bribing me with 25 and 50 pound payments but weren't able to assure me customer service wouldn't continue to lie. I told them i was not interested. He closed the complaint as resolved despite me pointing out it was very much not resolved and marking it so suggests no learning will come of it. They have hounded me with text messages and emails today. When I was forced to call customer service to tell them to stop, they refused. I contacted the Executive Team. They responded saying they trust I'm happy now the matter is resolved. Unbelievable.Three teach their customer service reps to lie to customers when they make a mistake.I paid extra for an upgraded phone to be delivered on a Saturday. It didn't arrive. Neither did any dispatch notifications. On Monday morning I called Three and was told it would be delivered that day and I'd receive a message to select a delivery time slot. No apology was made or explanation given for why it wasn't delivered and no offer to refund the fee paid to specify Saturday delivery. Delivery was free for weekday delivery.I waited for a notification as promised but by 4pm I thought I better call them. For 40 minutes, I was lied to about them checking a DPD tracking number that didn't exist, checking with other departments and given promises that conflicted with what I was told in the morning. When I asked for the tracking number they admitted they didn't have one. I was put on hold 4 times and each time the poor woman came back, it was with another lie about the status of my phone delivery. I was transferred to another woman who - only once pushed, admitted the phone hadn't been processed for delivery. I was told I would get a message in 48 hours telling me when it would be delivered (a few days before Christmas). I would find out WHEN it was being dispatched 5 days after it was due for delivery! As she confirmed my phone hadn't yet been dispatched, I asked to terminate my Three contract which runs out this month. She refused in case I receive and keep the phone they haven't sent me!!! Sadly, this is not the first customer service issue I've had with Three. After my 14 year old son died, I tried to terminate his phone contract. They again lied repeatedly month after month that the account had been closed only for a monthly direct debit to come through for six long months.

Signal was poor so had to cancel, which is fine it happens. But since trying to cancel I have had nothing but grief. I was told to return the router, but that I'd be sent return details in 2 days. This never happened, so on chasing I was told 5 days. Guess what? Didn't get sent! Chased again, customer service had no idea what I was talking about and I hit a brick wall.So I raised a complaint two weeks ago, hoping they'd take it a bit more seriously. Silly me. Had nothing back, and now am not even able to use the terrible online chat service to speak to someone. In the meantime I've received a bill for the next month's broadband (and follow-up threats as I obviously haven't paid it), as well as a warning bill of £100+ for not retuning the router. I'm just lost for words at how service could be this bad.Edit: the chat suggested is useless. I spent an hour 'resolving' this issue - finally getting them to commit to stop billing me, provide me returns details, and close my account, and even that made no difference. They keep closing my complaints and trying to get a follow up is a nightmare. So now I have a bill of £120 that again I have to try and deal with, presumably more wasted hours to come... # Dreadful customer service!",Negative,-0.214912281

Since September last year, being with Three has been an absolute nightmare! First of all, I couldn't use data roaming abroad for my entire holiday. Three online support kept telling me ""just turn it on on your app""... I kept insisting that I couldn't. So I was literally without mobile data for the week whilst abroad in a foreign country. THEN when I got home, FINALLY someone in the physical Three store had to call customer support on my behalf and INSIST that there simply wasn't the option for me to turn my data roaming on. Only then did they finally fix it for me!!Over the past three months, I've received the message ""your provider has turned off your mobile data"" completely out of the blue and with NO explanation. Each time I've had to waste at least an hour of my life on Live Chat getting it resolved. Each time they tell me it will be ""fixed"" but then... guess what?!! It happens again! They even sent me a replacement Sim card, insisting that must be the problem. So I tried it and... guess what, the same thing happened AGAIN!! I literally spent THREE hours of my life on live chat trying to lodge a formal complaint to just let them let me leave my fixed term contract early without cancellation fees, but obviously they won't let me and just take me round and round in circles.Absolutely disgraceful service. Never again in my life will I ever use Three again once my contract ends!! (And I'll be over the moon when it does!)In order to ""resolve"" my issues they then offered to call me, but they can only call me during my work hours which I've TOLD them I can't simply stop doing my job to take their call.

Three,5,GB,1,How not to treat loyal customers !,17-Dec-23,5c241101-00ce-4eae-9bfd-e9a01b57c47e,"I will start with a positive, in that when we initially joined 3 we had 2 years of hassle free, cheap phone usage. The problems started when our 2-year contract was about to end. The first thing that I thought was really bad is that I was offered a new deal that was a 50% increase on our old one. Mind you might saw well inflation etc however if I went to the 3 website but didn’t sign in as a customer I was offered a deal the same as original i.e. 50% less than my new offer, I thought that was a bit sneaky. Then when I asked for the PAC code to leave, I suddenly got offered the better deal. So, ok this isn’t the worst thing in the world so I resigned my wife and I for a new 2-year contract paying by direct debit. Now the fun started, the first payments came out of our accounts, great, but then my wife started receiving phone calls saying she had not paid and she must now pay? Then the texts started saying she hadn’t paid her bill. So, as you seem only to be able to speak to a human if you are getting a new contract I used the web chat (  goes on for so long it’s a joke ).  After about 35 minutes online I eventually got an apology about the harassment and was assured it would not happen again as the nonpayment was indeed “system fault “. Guess what, we are now still being harassed on a regular basis with calls and texts. The latest text saying we need to pay to stop debt recovery measures!  Well, I hope the well-paid CEO of Three reads this (which I doubt) to see how his company is treating long term customers. Also, if this continues, I may have to take legal action against 3 to stop their unfounded harassment! NB : Also If you are 3, please do not just say ""go to our chat and someone will help you"" as I have done this twice which took considerable time with absolutely no joy !

Tried to report a stolen phone @8pm on a Saturday - Website directs to a phone number which isn't open after 8pm and neither was the website chat option. This leaves the automated response the only option after hours and that seeks verifaction by sending a text - to the stolen phone so the customer is open to fraud.  Waited 13 hours until call centre opened and the only means to get the phone cancelled was to choose the 'upgrade your phone' option on automated menu as the others go back through the loop with verification sent to the stolen phone.  Eventually spoke to someone in customer services who acknowledged this was a problem and it is in complaints procedure.

How would I even possibly be able to make phone calls, texts and use my data within seconds of the top up? Vikram was extremely ignorant and would only say ""our system is very accurate and does not show wrong usage"" with his final action being termination of the chat when I asked for the matter to be escalated further.

This is only a minor issue compared to everything else I’ve dealt with. I waited for around 2 weeks and then checked me emails, I was told my order was cancelled and I’d no longer be getting the phone. No one gave me a reason as to why, it was just cancelled. And if I wanted a new phone I’d need to order one. I ordered a natural titanium one instead as this was actually next day, I got the phone and this was all sorted… so I thought. Fast forward another 2 weeks I have a delivery of a black  iPhone 15 pro max, I was honestly baffled as I was told this was cancelled. After countless hours on chats to useless advisors, I finally found out that for some reason my order had been processed TWICE and I was going to be charged for 2 phone contracts!! I obviously wanted to cancel the black I phone as I now am using the titanium and it’s been set up for weeks, so I arranged for a return, I STILL haven’t been sent the returns label. Not only this, three told me they couldn’t cancel the direct debit and I’d have to get my bank to do it. Luckily my bank were helpful and sorted this for me today. I then told three I wanted compensation for the hassle I’ve had to go through, including the 2 days that the network was down and I couldn’t use my phone, and I was told it was my fault as the order went through twice I must have ordered 2 phones and to contact them once I have returned the phone.

Three,2,US,1,Believe every single terrible,14-Dec-23,1c95565f-b9fe-4b94-87f4-ce716f13fab5,"Believe every single terrible you've ever read, and assume the absolute worst. I signed on with a 2 year contract, which should have been over in October of this year (2023). Three talked a big game about offering e sims (it was even advertised on the website). When I attempted to load it onto my phone and reached out to customer service, it wasn't even available. They claimed they did not yet have the ability.... bruv- you advertised it!Not only that, but I never had full service anywhere I went. Not a single spot I was in (never in London, and most certainly not outside of the city. It was rare service speed reached above 3G, and most certainly NEVER reached 5G). In September I attempted to cancel, I got stuck in a frustrating loop of conversation via chat. I said I wanted to cancel, the representative would ask me why, after giving explanation, they ARGUED WITH ME! It took me 45 minutes to get them to agree to move forward with the cancellation. At one point I had to say, and I quote, “Please, just cancel my bleeding contract, I’m begging you!”The agent then offered a PAC to transfer my number... I accepted. The language they sent implied that I must use the number within 30 days and that I would be charged for the month my number was held. Because my contract was ending and I could not have been more explicit about the fact that I wanted to cancel, my incorrect assumption was that I would have the final month of my contract to decide if I wanted to transfer my old number to a new service and if not, I would pay my final month and be done. WRONG. Apparently, three suspends, but does not cancel if you do not use your PAC and transfer to a new service, and then continues to charge for the service you’re not using. Having come from another country, I’d never even heard of this. Continuously charging for a service outside of a contract that isn’t even being used? Ridiculous.Also, when your account becomes suspended, they remove the ability to access your online portal, which then makes it impossible to view your bills or account online, thereby making it impossible to pay w/out the help of an agent via chat or phone. In addition, the monthly charge I was paying on contract included both payment for my phone and service…. Three continued to try and charge me the same cost each month, despite my phone being paid off in October….After realizing our account had gone into collections because three had been continuously charging us, my wife and I went through several hours of having to try and reach someone through chat and/or phone. Cancellation and billing are two separate departments, apparently, so we ended up getting bounced back and forth on an excruciatingly slow chat.I then decided to call instead, the conversation went like this:Agent: I need the name on the accountMe: Sure, it’s __wife’s first___wife’s last___Agent: That’s not the correct name, you have two more chances to give me the correct nameMe: I’m fairly certain that’s the correct name. Maybe her middle name is there? It could be ___wife’s first___middle___last name____Agent: Is that the name you want to use? Me: It’s either that or my name. I’m not sure why this is a problem when I’ve used the same name in chat and given all the necessary info. I can give you email address, birthday, address on the account.These are the only two options: my name or my wife’s. I just need to have a bill sent to me.Agent: You have to choose one.Me: I literally gave you the only two names that are possibly on the account and you can see it in front of you. Why is this so hard? We go round and round like this for several minutes until I simply have to hang up. My wife and I take our ID’s to an actual store, where they show us our account and GUESS WHAT, the first and second names I gave were correct, with the exception of the “Ms.” at the beginning of the name. The sales agents at the store gave us a link to take our situation directly to a complaint department and, update, the response team on Trustpilot responded below. So I used the link via trustpilot.After several hours and days of infuriating interactions, I finally got someone who helped take care of the closure and extra charges, which in the end equalled nearly £115. Though the agent did eventually help me, it was at that point far too late.TLDR: Service is terrible and interactions w/ anyone except people at the very end of the line of your complaint path are excruciating. It is my opinion that the company relies on shady, yet “technically legal” policies to continue making money , and they depend on people becoming so frustrated and frazzled that they’d do anything to get out of the loop of gaslighting and argument, including paying any amount.Save yourself and just avoid.An update several weeks later now on 22/1: Three has attempted to charge my account yet again. # Believe every single terrible",Negative,-0.066554677

After exciting my contract after not getting through to anyone at customer care. They sent me a cancellation charge notice of £235 I only pay £17 a month. Went through 4 different calls with them all regarding this charge one agent advised me to cancel my new contract and come back reinstate my old contract and then cancel it after 30 days as that's all he could do. After I had my pac code I called them up for the 5th time and was told that that's not an option and that I'm lying. When I requested a complaints form gdpr form and escalation to manament they failed to send me anything. Manger calls me back the next day calls me liar said he'll send me the complaint in an email and details to complain to the ombudsman but again no email. In that time tho 3 has sent me 3 notices that they'll take the 235 out of my account.

There is no such thing as loyalty anymore.It's been 6 weeks at least since leaving three, but they still think I'm a customer of theirs. Even though I transferred to another network with PAC code and have thankfully cancelled my direct debits, three still don't know how to issue a final bill to close my accounts.

The phone didn’t arrive but I have been charged for the contract even after trying to cancel it and speaking to three on multiple occasions. The phone itself was cancelled by the security team and I was reassured the contract would be cancelled and I could order the device again. But, every time I speak to three since the initial conversation about the cancelled phone delivery, I get a different story or even fail security because of a verification code being sent to a phone I do not have, which the staff are aware of when I speak to them. ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. I am no closer to having this contract cancelled after 6 calls, 2 failed web chats, 2 attempts at raising a complaint verbally and one complaints form being submitted.

Though it wasn't a good deal (it was worse than new customers are offered), I agreed as I was fed up and they wouldn't give me anything better. In the end I accepted 12gb data for 12 months, where a new customer would have 25gb for the same price.Anyway, the emails come through, the plan goes live, and I see it is set up for 24 months. Not what I agreed. I tried to contact them several times, passed pillar to post, cut off by around 5 different agents - probably because I wasn't an easy sale for their targets. My complaint has been raised since 22/11/2023, and not a word has been received since. It should be a 2 minute job to check the chat transcript (which apparently the chat agents can't provide me), acknowledge the mistake and correct the plan. Without doubt this is the worst customer service I've had in years. I will not be renewing after this contract is over (whether they amend it or not) and I'm recommending everyone I know not to join three. I've been a customer for at least 8 years, and this is how I'm treated. Also, side issue, the data allowances just aren't correct. I was receiving text messages saying I'd ran out of data while the app was showing ~1gb left whilst I was in Poland.

They sent me instructions on how to log into the app... which don't work because it doesn't recognise my number to take me to the next step, as I explained.

Even they now had a DNA sample on top of all of my security questions they wanted me to:a) remove the sim card from the dongle and put is in my phone to verify. Slight problem as the card is old and does not fit the smaller box on the iPhone.b) waste hours of my day by going to a 3 dealer to verify.Simply told them, dongle well and truly out of contract and not been used for years, that it was cancelled and I killed the direct debit.Now they are harassing me for an outstanding bill of £63.11 and threatening to refer to a debt collector. Too late, they've already marked my account with all the credit bureaus. This WAS CANCELLED and UNUSED.Our local 3 coverage was down for about 4 days and they lied by saying that no further problems existed halfway in. That's four phone contracts with no coverage. Totally useless, cheap as chips, customer ""care"". Can I have my money back for the years that you just pocketed the cash?Now another ""customer care"" parasite has intervened and upped the final amount to close to £100 outstanding for a cancelled product that has not been used for YEARS.

Three,1,GB,1,Absolutely awful experience,06-Dec-23,a44bab81-e16f-4ce4-b00f-6a8dd6f64d16,"Absolutely awful experience. I ordered 5G home broadband and decided within the 14 day cooling period that it wasn’t for me and requested cancellation. Nothing wrong with the product it just wasn’t really what I needed. They couldn’t do it over chat so had to spend ages on hold on the phone. I finally spoke to someone who cancelled it for me, and arranged a DPD collection of the router. This was the start of the circus of events. I never received the DPD label so had to call them up again, the person who I spoke to this time tells me that the cancellation hadn’t actually been put through!?!Fast forward a few days, I finally receive the DPD label and send the router back to them. The DPD tracking confirms that they received the parcel a few days after I sent it. A week or two passes and then get harassed by numerous texts, emails and phone calls telling me that I owe them more money - even though I cancelled within the cooling off period and assured (and I have it writing from the chat transcript) that I have nothing else left to pay! To top it off, I’m told that they cannot find the parcel and that they are going to do an internal investigation which might take a few weeks and told that I need to pay the money that they seem to think I owe or risk having my credit score affected and debt collectors instructed. To date, I’ve had 3 phone calls and at least 5 live chats with them and the issue is still ongoing. I work in IT customer services and I’m normally very patient and understanding - mistakes can happen. This is also the first time I’ve ever left a Trustpilot. However, this experience has been so absolutely appalling - I don’t think you can provide worse customer service if you tried.

As my contract was concluding, I decided to take out a new plan. Unfortunately, I encountered issues with the new SIM card, and after spending nearly 3 hours on a call, the representative suggested a phone reset and promised to call me back. However, the callback never happened, prompting me to cancel within 3 days.Despite the company offering a 14-day cooling-off period on new contracts, I found myself charged even after canceling within the specified timeframe. My attempts to address the issue involved making eight calls, each time being informed that the department was busy. On my ninth call, after almost 2 hours on hold, I finally reached someone who assured me that the problem was resolved.To my dismay, two weeks later, I discovered negative marks on my credit report and debt collectors pursuing me. My subsequent three calls to resolve the situation were met with persistent hang-ups. The chat feature proved equally frustrating, with responses taking nearly 10 minutes for a single message. The assurances received were generic, stating an understanding of my concern and a commitment to resolving the issue.Now, three months later, the problem remains unresolved. This has left me feeling hopeless, particularly as it has affected my ability to secure the house I intended to rent. Despite repeated promises of resolution, there has been no discernible progress. # 14 day cool off period but still chraged for the year",Negative,-0.009232072

This continued several times over. Back and fourth.

Three,1,GB,1,Nasty customer experience at 3 Mobile store in Croydon CR0 1TG,30-Nov-23,7452472b-1553-4072-963b-ea934fdf9929,"I have been a longstanding customer of 3 Mobile. On Monday 27 November 2023 I went to upgrade my phone at the Croydon store. The female manager on duty and sales advisor were very customer friendly, spoke to me in a respectful manner as they should. I took an iPhone 15 plus contract and was offered some extras including a case, glass protector at a ""discount"" I was told. I paid for whatever and went home. When I tried later to put the phone together both glass and case were not the right fit. 3 Mobile's return policy states that in the case of a faulty product the customer can return the protect for either a refund, exchange etc. Without the customers statutory rights being affected. So on Thursday 30 November 2023, I returned to the store to get the items exchanged and met the unprofessional, manager that I have ever met on earth. He lacked any sense of that vital customer service skills needed for one in such a position and did not appear to know 3 Mobile's returns policy. He unintelligently and ignorantly insisted that the sales advisor had made a mistake giving me the discount to which I asked rightly how that was my problem. In a manner which I deemed insulting, he stated that he was giving me 2 options - 1. Return the items for a refund 2. Keep the faulty items. By then his colleague had gone for the right products and was prepared to do the exchange at no cost. This rude manager kept on about just the two options despite me reminding him of the company's return policy. I asked to speak to his senior manager to which he replied that he was the manager and there was no one above him (obviously this cannot be true). On the end he accused me of raising my voice so asked me to leave the store. All this took place in the full glare of customers around the reception area. I am asking 3 Mobile to investigate this horrible behaviour of the manager and communicate the outcome to me. I want the products exchanged within 7 days. I want an apo,ogu from this manager if not I will seek legal advice and cancel all my contracts with 3 Mobile. # Nasty customer experience at 3 Mobile store in Croydon CR0 1TG",Negative,-0.029421769

I spent 45 minute explaining that I needed someone to call to switch my number to business. They couldn't grasp this and kept saying my number is a consumer number. I explained that it is currently but it should be switched over. They asked for my business phone number but this doesn't show on the new sim and I didnt think I needed this as my number should transfer over. This went on for 45 mins and they finally asked if I wanted to buy a business sim. I called a different number and was told I now have two accounts and they didnt change my old one to a business account. So now I am paying twice and have a business number and phone I can't use.

The most unhelpful, useless staff that absolutely cannot be bothered to do what they’re paid for. My contract with EE was due to renew but I wanted to look at other, cheaper options. Came across a great deal on Three for an iPhone 15, £60 upfront, all sorted. Two days later I receive an email to say that the order has been cancelled, weird but not the end of the world. Assuming my contract with three has been cancelled hence the email, I went with O2, received the phone the next day and started a contract with them, all smooth, cannot fault them at all. A few weeks later I receive an email from Three to say that my phone, that they said was cancelled, is due for delivery, today!!!! Numerous amounts of conversations with Three and was assured more than 3 times that my £60 refund is on the way and it has been cancelled. The phone turns up, even though Three CANCELLED IT with no explanation, ASSURED me 3 times it was definitely cancelled and the refund was on the way. I had to give the phone back to the DPD driver as I already sorted out another contract. He said he would give it back to the warehouse. I then spoke to someone from Three and they said that it’s absolutely no problem, they can see the refund is on the way and they will sort out the phone that I sent back, AGAIN, reassured for completely false promises, does anyone working for Three actually know what they’re doing? Or do they just brush problems under the carpet because they cannot simply be bothered to deal with them? Thinking that it has finally been sorted, I then receive an email 2 days later saying that my first direct debit bill is due in December, so once again, my phone was not cancelled, I was lied to AGAIN. Back on the phone again, was on the phone for an hour and a half, put through to 5 different people as they couldn’t understand what was going on. Finally, received  a text to say the number had been disconnected, and was verbally given a cancellation number over the phone, apparently they cannot send over a cancellation email????? I am still not convinced that this has been cancelled.

Three,9,GB,1,Unacceptable Customer Service,28-Nov-23,ea70bc83-7947-4bf1-bb01-ba1121e318f9,"Having been a customer of three mobile for approximately 15 years, I am disappointed to say that earlier this year 2023, I started to experience the sorry state that this company have become. What initially commenced as a problem with using my phone abroad, quickly turned into a customer service nightmare. This was following a staff mix up on my account. I was repeatedly trying to speak to customer service representatives who would not discuss my account with me due to security concerns. I have literally spent hours trying to resolve this issue, on the phone, via online chat, spoke to staff in a three store, all to no avail. All I was told is that a new computer system is causing staff a nightmare. I submitted a complaint but received no response. Regrettably, I decided to leave three mobile a few months ago, as did a number of other members of my family, simply because of the utter shameful experience I had been subjected to. I have been treated appallingly, and I am now being contacted daily stating that I owe a bill of approximately £23. I wanted to discuss this bill with staff but given that customer service representatives won't speak to me due to a security issue, I have been unable to resolve this. The shear number of texts, letters to my home address in relation to owing this amount are now verging on harassment. It is absolute incompetence. I cannot in good conscience pay for a service which I have not appropriately received. The whole experience has left me stressed to the point where I am now going to explore avenues of recourse against three. It is quite simply disgusting customer service. Had a representative been willing to discuss my account with me on several occasions, I have no doubt that this would have been resolved amicably, and I together with my family members would still be three customers. The company priorities and service have deteriorated beyond belief. I am shocked that any customer would be treated this way, but it makes it all the more upsetting given how long I was a customer for. If three do read these messages and are able to use my name to link my old account, please update accordingly with this. For any prospective customers, I can only advise that you avoid three at all costs. Your loyalty will mean nothing, but most importantly, if you do experience any problems, and it is likely that you will, don't expect to get anything resolved via customer service. I am now a customer of O2. As a note to anyone believing that three are giving a caring response to these, the link provided in other customer simply take you to the three website, and the merry go round will commence again.

However we wanted to check the balance and found the system has changed, don't dial a number, look it up on line. We have no recollection of being contacted about this. Went on line and needed to 're-register' for which the instructions given on the Three website proved entirely useless. During our attempt, clicking for an email re password reset elicited no action and clicking on the 'chat' button was equally unresponsive. Wouldn't dare try phoning (especially at 25p a minute!). They couldn't make HELP any less helpful if they tried. Avoid at all costs.Following this I received a response from Three saying they were sorry to hear of my experience and giving a link to their 'specialist team' who ""who will look into this further and find out what has happened and give you the support needed"". With eager anticipation I followed the link and found a page with a click to chat option. I clicked, several times, and nothing happened - again. I then clicked on the 'support' tab and got back to the same useless options I'd previously seen. If that was their 'specialist team' best effort there's no hope for us!If they really cared they'd give me an address to which to send them the phone number and I'm sure it would be possible, even simple, for them to look up the balance and tell me.

Both alternative deals were more expensive than my expiring contract (which they said I could keep) with no added benefits.Ied options and decided to leave Three.I called for a PAC code. I responded to the auto attendant pressing the relevent keys and answering the relevent security. I then had to listen to an advert for a new phone before being put through to an attendant. The attendant then asked to to confirm the detail I had already completed via the auto attendent. I commented that this was poor form for a communications company. She then asked me the reason for leaving, I saw no reason to answer so replied, ""because it is a Sunday"", she was confused (I assume not an option on her checklist). I asked for the PAC code again, she sai she needed a reason for me leaving. I stated ""no reason"" she refused the PAC code. So I then stated that the reason was poor service and again asked for the PAC code. She then said I had to listen to terms and conditions for getting a PAC code. I was amazed and expressed it. She then started telling me the details of my existing contract (as if I was a moron) and then tried to sell me a new contract. This did it, I insisted she stop talking and just give me a PAC code. I mean how ridiculous can Three be think you are going to stay with them if they make it awkward to leave - it only reinforced to me how desperate they are.Anyway she then said she had to speak to someone to get authority to give me a PAC code.

One ill turn leads to another, and my trouble with Three seems endless. Following my second, after I cancelled my contract for my portable Wi-Fi device, I have still been pestered to settle the payment for the first month of service, although I had never used it since the SIM card didn’t work, as detailed in my last. I called its 0333338 1031 hotline to enquire on 13 November at around 11 a.m. about the 'payment'. The receptionist asked me to go to that shop again to get proof of cancellation, as if I had told a lie. I didn't expect that I would be regarded as a suspect by the company, even though it is its fault in internal communication. I believe it is very easy for its staff to check the cancelled contract and the refund to verify what I said, given the account number I gave. And it was supposed that its account staff would check customers' account information carefully before issuing any payment notice. As a helpless individual customer, I care about my credit record, so I went to the Argyle Street shop again to try to settle the matter on 26 November around 3: 30 p.m. The supervisor Stuart adamantly insisted that I pay the fee for the first month, although I had already cancelled the contract, and that his other colleague had proved a mistake on the part of one of his colleagues. He said that I would be refunded after I pay the bill. It is ridiculous logic, which shows the serious problem in internal communication in the company, which causes inconvenience and unfairness to customers.

Two months later, Three tell me that I'm now locked into a 2 year contract for a service that is unusable the download being so slow that web pages will often time out before they finish loading. To put this in context, my office is in the center of Norwich less than 1km from the base station.The techies at Three are polite and try to help but just take you through the usual routine of turning the router off then on again along with the odd request to press the reset button.Of course none of this helps because the problem is not in the router but rather in the network.Other times when contacting Three there will be an automated message about ""Traffic congestion on the network in your area which we apologize for and which our team are working to correct"".OFCOM really need to look at this as selling people contracts for services that cannot possibly be delivered must surely be a breach of both contract law and the terms of Three's license.UPDATE:After another long conversation with Three staff I was told that because the problem was due to network issues they would let me cancel the contract without penalty.

As a customer with a long-standing history with your company, I am appalled at the treatment I have received throughout this process. I am a woman of a certain age, and the distress and inconvenience caused by the inability to use my phone are immeasurable.

Three,13,GB,3,Was good.   Now Three Mobile is not so good.,01-Aug-23,b18f9f97-d2c3-4194-bb82-b21809b1c8a4,"I’ve been a customer of three for as long as I can recall.  In May 2011 I started going for packaged deals for the Samsung Galaxy S phones, starting out with the S2.  I then routinely upgraded and had the S4, S6 Edge, S8, S10, S21 Ultra 5G.  Historically I’ve found Three had the best prices and I was reasonably happy with the service.The reason I have now abandoned Three and Samsung is due to poor service from Three Mobile.  I pledge never to use the mobile provider by choice again and am sitting out the end of a contract to wave goodbye finally.  Allow me to explain …In July 2023, Samsung’s new Galaxy Fold 5 was available for pre-order, and Three had some good deals.  I went through the Three upgrade process and the experience broke down from there.The deal was Order Number : 139953671ADevice name: Samsung Galaxy Fold 5 512GB Icy BlueMSISDN: xxxxxxxxx55Device cost: £1746.00Upfront payment: £90.00Total agreement amount: £1656.00Monthly device payment: £69.00Number of installments: 24APR: 0%Unfortunately, Three took the £90 deposit twice by mistake.  When I phoned customer service to try and rectify that, Three canceled my order before it was shipped.  This was not what I requested, and I never did get my hands on the shiny new handset.  I was told I would get a refund of my deposits.Since then I have had to call Three Mobile weekly to try and get my money back, being short £180 due to an error made by Three mobile is unacceptable.  The mind-boggling process of calling Three customer support and trying to explain the above scenario sent me mildly insane.  I have call logs showing calls to customer service for typically 45 minutes at a time, sometimes twice a week, trying to argue my case for a refund of the deposit.  I have now given up and put the loss down to experience.I have placed a complaint with three (ref 230802101205784), which they shut down without any investigation.  I have since been working with my bank, but as Three has never confirmed in writing I am due the 2 x £90 deposits returned, the bank cannot help.  For the record, Three only ever confirmed on one of the many calls I was due to receive a refund on the deposit automatically, never in writing.My most recent interactions with Three Customer Service seemed promising. I was instructed to send all kinds of docs with proof of transaction details to their proofs department.  Despite them giving me several follow-up call, I eventually just got the following email responseFrom: Three noreplySent: Friday, October 27, 2023 1:18:01 PMTo: my email removedSubject: Update on your queryHi there,Your query has now been closed.Any questions? Get in touch.Thanks,The Three TeamIn summary, I give up. I never want to speak to Three again to protect my sanity.  In the past, I have recommended Three to pretty much all my friends and family.  I am now doing the opposite and advising people to move away from Three Mobile.With respect to my long-lived enthusiasm for Samsung phones, this whole palaver made me look wider, and here I discovered the amazing OnePlus Fold phone.  Had this sorry story not have happened, I’m sure I would be perfectly happy with the Samsung phone.

Here is my experience dealing with them, I encourage you to never ever deal with this company.Called to cancel my contract with Three back in September as I don't use it enough, I ended up getting a new phone with the lowest sim deal I could get. Requested for a new Sim card to be delivered ASAP as I don't have the sim anymore.November, still no phone and sim card. Paying for a contract that I have no use. Called the Customer Service team to ask for an update - Apparently my order has been stuck and they can't give me a delivery date. I was put on hold for 15 minutes and was told that the phone should be delivered in the next 2 days.5 days later, still no phone. Called the Customer Service to cancel the contract as very frustrated at this stage. Cancelled 10+ years of contract with Three and the Phone order. I asked the agent multiple-times for confirmation of this cancellation.2 Days later, they still delivered the phone. Three lines are down, I engaged their customer services team via Web chat to try and return the phone and confirm the cancellation of the contract. After spending 2 hours and 30 minutes and being transferred 4x to teams that apparently will be able to 'HELP', I found out that the contract hasn't been cancelled and which means that the Retention agent lied in cancelling this. The Options supervisor 'Chantin' scheduled to call me in the next 10-15 minutes to get me routed to the correct team as the phone lines are down - NEVER CALLED. Waited for 30 minutes for a phone call.I only wanted to confirm the cancellation of the contract and return the phone that they delivered even though I've requested for it to be cancelled.How do they even exist with such bad customer service team and process in place?

Every month they prompt you to install adware and apps they ""recommend"" on to your phone. They also have started doing this automatically. I accidently approved this one month and now I have to block the notification on my phone so they don't remotely download apps and programmes I don't want on to my phone without my consent which I find very invasive and poor. Their coverage is terrible despite what they claim in their advertisements and I would never recommend trading in any phone with them as I feel I was scammed on this when I upgraded. Due to a minimal amount of screen burn, that I was barely aware of, I got pretty much scrap value and this was processed very quickly without checking with me, meaning I had to accept what they paid me. It would have been much fairer to wait until I accepted the new price they offered but I imagine they knew I wouldn't and would have gone elsewhere to get a fairer price. Honestly I've been counting down my contract ever since it started so I can swap to another provider as this contract was the final straw despite being with them for many years now at this point.

Three,9,GB,1,Refused to let me file a complaint,16-Nov-23,39c2a63f-b42b-46aa-9110-fb2dd58724b9,"Refused to let me file a complaint. Of everything that I have experienced with the Three network this past week, my last phone call with them was impressively awful. I was on the phone for just under an hour, and kept asking to be transferred to the complains department which I was told to do when I went in store by a member of Three staff. I explained why I wanted to complain about the service I have received and was just told I would not be transferred. I asked why and wasn’t given any logical reason. They then kept me on hold I assume it was delay tactics, hoping I would just hang up. Every few minutes the same person came back on the line to tell me to stay on the line and I would then be transferred. I was then told to hang up the phone and management would contact me. They refused to let me file a complaint. I literally begged on the phone to let me make a complaint. Was repeatedly told they would not transfer me to the complaints department.  For some reason they like their specific language at Three and unless you know exactly how to word what you want - you won’t get it, but will be led to assume otherwise. I was told a week later, that because I did not specifically ask for a “cancellation request” a cancellation was not made. Asking for my contract to not auto renew is synonymous with cancellation, and I was led to believe that my issue had been solved. There was no clarification of language at all and I was not made aware I would still be charged when obviously that is the whole point of my call.   I called to ensure my contract would not renew, and I was told yes no worries, thanks for your call, and that I did not need to do anything to change my contract it would just expire on the date it finishes and I was told I did not need to do anything else. Prior to this I went on the live chat to ask simply would my contract auto renew and if it did, I didn’t want this. I was asked if I wanted to cancel my contract and I said I want it to run as it does, as I need it for these next couple of days before it ends, but when it expires I want it to be finished, not auto renew, done with. Again, I specifically asked the person on the phone to make sure my contract did not renew. They told me it would not.  I got a new SIM card on pay as you go, and it came with a new number. I got in contact again to ask for my old number back but with this new pay as you go deal on it. I asked explicitly, at least twice, to ensure that my new pay as you go deal was on the new SIM but with my old number.  Yes yes, of course, this is fine, I was told by the staff on live chat.  I got a new SIM, this is my second SIM now. I got my old number yes, but my old contract was live again when I checked. My pay as you go deal wasn’t on this SIM.  I got in contact again, and was told it’s impossible to transfer number in Three. Why was I assured otherwise then? The staff I spoke to on live chat, and then on the phone were so rude and I was growing increasingly upset as I had spent so much time talking to people at Three and they were all giving different solution, whilst still somehow behind extremely unhelpful. The whole ordeal was so distressing. I went in store to speak to staff and I was told to get a new SIM with a different network provider, like 02 or Vodafone, get a PAC code from Three, transfer my number to them, and then transfer back to Three. I asked in store to make a complaint, and I was redirected to call up again, and ask for the complaints department. I did this, and was denied entirely. I was shouted at down the phone, again. Every single time I have spoken with Three, I have been spoken down to, transferred an unnecessary amount of times, been shouted at, and given wrong advice and instructions.  I genuinely believe that they have no idea what they are doing, and just transfer because they can’t be bothered with your issue. This is how they made me feel on multiple occasions. Outrageous customer service.*******Update Edit:Three have replied to my asking to get in touch. Been on live chat, on the phone, and in store trying to rectify the situation. I've already tried this. Just going round in circles.

No way of even accessing their web-chat, which is inactive even during the hours when they say it *should be* active.  I'm assuming that this will trigger a meaningless response from Three. I'm assuming that they have an AI-bot that can recognise negative comments here and simply respond with a scripted response—it doesn't seem as if anyone is actually doing anything meaningful behind the scenes apart from saying how sorry they are (they seem to be *really, really, really* sorry all the time, which is just *fantastic*, right?)In the meantime, what has *really* helped me is converting my frustration and disbelief into something positive—I've dissuaded perhaps five people so far *not* to take out contracts with Three; it makes a big difference feeling that at least I have some power in this situation.

Your generic and identical responses to our complaints do not help. If you are genuine you would reach out to suggest a mediation path rather than flog us all off to a useless chat session that resolves nothing. How about a dedicated complaints forum with a real human with real experience?  Too much to ask probably.A recent data migration of Three accounts resulted in my PAYG data plan failing resulting in £60 of out of pocket unplanned expenses. Three will not tell you their data migration failed for specific accounts. I’m guessing it was related to transitioning to O2 but they’re keeping it very quiet. It took 3 calls and nearly 3 hours of wasted time - the final call to some offshore manager who thought they knew what they were talking about to a try to resolve the issue. The guy was rude and abrupt and did not resolve my issue but opted for an easy solution to simply apply £60 credit to my account - even that was like pulling hens teeth and he made out it was my fault and would not accept the fact that their failed data migration was the root cause!! He did NOT fix the actual issue and reinstate my £20pm unlimited plan. Could not believe how rude the guy was blaming me for their mistake!!!As such, my £60 credit very quickly eroded as I was exposed to their standard call, text and data charges when away from wifi. I was unable to purchase the same PAYG data plan let alone any data plan as it complained that I could only have one active data plan - even though that data plan was no longer active! Total mess. Anyway I ended up ditching Three and moved elsewhere to a much cheaper deal. There’s plenty of competition out there but I will never return to Three unless they completely revamp their customer service.

One being that the contract was too new and I didn't have the luxury to use this abroad. Unfortunately this happened during a difficult time for my family and me having no phone meant I missed calls from my parents letting me know my Grandfather had died, which meant I could not speak to him before he passed.

When I got my SIM only contract once my initial contract including the phone finished, I was promised I would continue to be able to roam in the EU. When I spoke to the agent I made it incredibly clear this was a requirement for me. Once I set it up, it turned out I couldn't, and had to pay an additional £2-£5 per day for EU roaming. When I recently went to Turkey, I refused to buy an extortionately expensive ""data passport"" and tried to turn on roaming occassionally instead. It never worked, so I gave that up after two tries, but of course I received a nice £60 ""out of bundle"" charge on my latest bill. Originally my SIM only contract was £9.95 p/m. A year later that was increased to £20 p/m for that same deal for no good reason: 12GB of data without EU roaming. I will be moving to O2, where I will be paying £13 p/m for 60GB of data incl. roaming in AND outside of the EU. Absolute no-brainer. Of course, as soon as I cancelled I received a phone call with some ""offers"" to make me stay. I will never understand why companies push and push, by increasing bills, charging for previously free functionality, just to see how far they can go until you leave. And only then will give you a slightly more reasonable offer, which was still much worse than my new deal with O2. Instead of looking after their customers, they bet on their complacency to switch, while going ahead and increase their cost over and over. I will avoid Three going forward. # Avoid",Positive,0.094454545

If you're having trouble pairing a watch, create a temporary password with no special characters and all lowercase letters. Once the pairing is complete, you can change your password back to normal.Apart from this minor hiccup, I've been thoroughly impressed with Three's service.

Told me I could use it monthly basis, if I did not like bring it to the Store. before 12 November to cancel, I tried it for a week, honestly It did not meet up my internet, I connected after one day, went back to the store and I saw Store Manager (MR BABS) only walking around, with no smile serious faced always sitting behind the Dividers. I asked Babs Can you help me to open the safe networking? He rudely told me 'you need to wait for Sales Rep.' I casually asked you are the Store Manager? why can't you assist me? He told me, he cannot. I sat for 30 minutes-Mr Pervez did it within 5 minutes-Again I went to the Store to cancel and return the hub as per Pervez instructions- I met new sales guy, said Pervez does not work here anymore. I got panicked coz what he told, I put audio on to record our conversation. and told the sales guy I'm recording it. I told him that I came to return this asper Pervez. He went inside and got the same Store Manager Mr BABS (as usual he always sat inside the partition.) Both said I cannot return it today, told them it was not in use for 2 weeks, I was told to bring it here in the store. Then Store Manager said that I cannot be recording the conversation saying it is illegal to do it without its consent- where is the law?  Babs could answer that. He further went on to say I have intimidated the sales staff, that I am a immature and that I'm gone call Three Headquarters to barre me the store. then he took his phone and started video recording without asking me. The Same Manager few minutes that it is illegal to record and yet he was breaking the law. They refused to accept that Hub. It cost me additional month charge because of all this-Never again I will try Three.Update on ComplaintThe complaint was responded to by Jonathan, he was apologetic, he said would give me a refund and I did see the Initial charge refunded. Nothing was discussed about the resolution on the bad unprofessional behaviour of the Store Manager Mr Babs who humiliated me in front of the customers and three sales representatives. I would really expect an apology from the store manager, a written note on my email. So the question remains whether I'm barred from coming to store ever  which was main reason I felt very insulted. Just today I received a message that the bill is ready and they will still charge 24 pounds. This is ironic, I have returned the Portable hub on 11th Nov as per Original Mr Pervez's Instructions. Who clearly told me to come to the one day prior ie 11th Nov, as I had signed Contract in the late afternoon of 12 Oct 2023. Hope they investigate the humiliation behaviour and take a deeper look into this matter seriously via store's CCTV. As there were witnesses including Three Sales Reps. And 2 Customers.

Three,9,IE,1,A Prolonged Saga of Inefficiency and Frustration with Three UK's Mobile Broadband Return Process,10-Nov-23,e0e14459-7a85-4c88-870a-f90643cfd348,"I find myself compelled to express my profound discontent with the abysmal experience I have endured while attempting to return a mobile broadband device to Three UK. The sheer magnitude of inefficiency and lackadaisical customer service I have encountered over the past two months is nothing short of exasperating, prompting me to share my grievances in this scathing.From the outset, my attempt to return the mobile broadband device has been akin to navigating a labyrinth of incompetence. Despite dedicating countless hours to live chat sessions and interminable phone calls, the resolution of my issue remains a distant mirage. The very essence of customer service appears to be lost on Three UK, as my pleas for assistance have fallen on deaf ears, leaving me in a perpetual state of frustration.One of the primary issues plaguing this nightmarish ordeal is the failure on the part of Three UK to dispatch a simple Jiffy bag to my new address. Two months into this kafkaesque journey, and the basic task of sending a return package still eludes them. The sheer lack of expedience in addressing this elementary matter is astounding and has left me questioning the competency of Three UK's logistics and operational capabilities.Adding insult to injury, I have been bombarded with perplexing emails asserting that I owe money to Three UK, a claim that is not only unfounded but deeply perplexing given that I exercised my right to cancel the contract within the stipulated 30-day cooling-off period, a mere seven days after signing the agreement. The audacity of Three UK to demand payment for a service that I no longer wish to avail myself of is nothing short of a breach of trust and a blatant disregard for customer rights.In an era where customer service should be a cornerstone of business ethics, Three UK's lamentable performance in handling my case serves as a stark reminder of the deficiencies prevalent in their organizational structure. The inertia displayed in addressing a straightforward return request and the inexplicable insistence on claiming payment for a terminated contract are indicative of a company that has lost sight of the very principles that underpin customer satisfaction.In conclusion, my harrowing experience with Three UK's mobile broadband return process has left an indelible mark on my perception of their brand. I implore potential customers to exercise caution before engaging with Three UK, as the tumultuous journey I have undertaken serves as a cautionary tale of the perils that await those who dare to entrust their business to an entity that seemingly values bureaucratic red tape over genuine customer service. # A Prolonged Saga of Inefficiency and Frustration with Three UK's Mobile Broadband Return Process",Positive,0.032815882

The deal was appealing, it was less than what I paid to Virgin. As I work from home it made sense to change over to a business package. Anyway it turned out to be the worst decision I ever made. Since I set up the internet, I cannot use any device consistently. I cannot carry out my business effectively. Teams meetings after 5 minutes are a shambles, fuzzy picture, cuts out every word, freezes, they tell me I’m glitching or they can’t see me. The constant lagging and buffering is so frustrating. It is the worst service I have ever experienced in my life I literally could cry. I have called them 5 times in less than a week. I have been told there is work being done to a mast in the area which could continue for several weeks I was told to swap the sim from the router to my phone to see if it’s a sim issue to now they will send me a replacement router which could take up to 4 working days and is currently being processed in their system. For the last few weeks I can’t watch any shows if wanted to on my tv or iPad. I can’t listen to music. I can’t arrange online meetings. I can’t connect my phones to the Wi-Fi to save data. I can’t use my laptop consistently. I can’t browse the internet. I study part time, I have two online training courses to complete, I have my own business and also have one 2 one classes to attend for other things. The whole purpose of getting a business set up is so I can run my business smoothly and do everything I need to in one go from the comfort of my home and now I can’t do that on any level. They say I cannot leave the contract as I will have to pay for the whole contract. I have to wait to see if the new router will work (I know It’s not a router issue, it’s a network and coverage issue) if it doesn’t they will carry out further investigations before deciding to refund me so I can be released from contract but the wait is just making it worse because they cannot confirm how long all of this will take leaving me further and further behind with the work I have to do. I have to pay for use of co working spaces just to be able to work properly and use the internet. There is no sense of urgency just an apology and we have to try this. Stay away from three 5g broadband. I do not have much of an issue with the sim only but the broadband is horrendous. If you want to use any device in your home or office three is not for you.

They then said that they had raised a case and I would be contacted within 5 working days to discuss the issue. Today, I get a text with questions about delivery and giving them a rating?

Three,7,GB,1,How is this company allowed to operate?,08-Nov-23,ced39a98-b3af-44aa-ad7a-00763eec5e5c,"The website is utterly useless. It makes me want to leave even though the internet connection is actually good. It is that bad.First of all, get rid of the requirement to use the ""Three phone number"" to start the process. I'm A BROADBAND CUSTOMER only. I don't want to fetch this number to log in. You should know what type of customer one is and should ask for the appropriate credentials. Or you could simply ask for an email and password, like every single other website on the planet.Second, even after using this number, the website doesn't work. The page asks me to do an A.I. captcha where I need to click on a two-legged hedgehog and after the mission is accomplished it goes blank or fails. This always happens on desktop. I already wasted a lot of time in the customer service chat to fix it and it is happening again.Third, even when finally managing to log in by using a mobile device, I still can never find where to change my payment method, because I use a recurring card and this is deliberately hidden as Three wants us to have a Direct Debit.After a lot of frustration, I see that in case of having a card as a payment method, apparently I'm supposed to call a number to make changes.NO. I'm not going to call. NO, I am not going to install an app. YOU make a website that is frictionless so I can update my payment methods in seconds like I do on ALL other websites I use.Truly hopeless, I don't know if you are blatantly incompetent or have a sneaky and disrespectful policy.Just to make extra clear: My account went into debt because THREE impeded my updating of my payment method details. This caused many debit collection SMSs to promptly arrive and for a number to call persistently, which some online checking confirms are scam callers.Quite A LOT of inconvenience for a problem I didn't create.The following 1h chat didn't solve the problem and, as the chat ended, an unrequested new chat automatically started, causing the transcript and survey page to disappear.

Three is an unacceptable company. This is coming from a long-term customer.My answer to Three's reply is as follows: The way you have set your rules and regulations means that customers are forced to pay for services that you no longer provide and long after they have left your company.

Three,1,GB,1,The WORST experience I've ever had with a company.,07-Nov-23,ac02acd1-19ac-4ebb-8736-e8b134c61325,"The WORST business encounter I have ever had. I don't generally complain and leave bad, but this needs to be mentioned. If you are considering doing business with Three, please read my evaluation. You will discover how much I was misled and lied to repetitively.For context: Around September 25th, I purchased a phone with Three. I decided to return the phone because I wasn't satisfied with its performance. I called the Three helpline number and discussed returning the phone. Note that each time you call this number, you will have to wait 30+ minutes to speak with an advisor. After a long call, I finally got a return code and sent the phone back on September 27th. Three have a 14-day return policy, where if you return your device within the 14-day period, you will not have to pay any charges, bills, or device plan agreements, and will have your upfront payment returned to you 'within 14 days.' On October 4th, I received an email saying Three have received my device and it has been checked and is fully up to standard. The email also mentioned I would receive the refund within 7 working days. I waited 7 working days, and then rang the Three helpline number again, where they tried to tell me the device hadn't yet been received! I went back and forth with the advisor and they refused to give me any more information. The next day I went and called again, was on the phone waiting for 45 minutes, and when they eventually answered, I got told the phone was received on the date I was told, and I should now be refunded 7 working days from that date. I started receiving emails saying, you have an overdue balance of something like £78 on your account. Over the total of this experience, I must've genuinely received at least 15 emails about this, and at least 5 letters saying if I didn't pay this bill, it could affect my credit score. I called Three again, asking why I was still receiving letters and emails and if the phone was going to be refunded to me. At this point, it's now around October 13th, and I have called multiple times. When I called, they mentioned that my 'final bill' had not even been generated yet, so I was still going to get charged for my device plan which I asked them to cancel multiple times before! On the phone, they told me they had now cancelled my agreement, and the final bill has been generated so I should wait 7 working days for the refund. So I waited 7 working days... and I was still receiving the emails and letters, but there was no sign of my refund! I once again called the Three helpline, and they told me the bill was now being generated, and I should wait 14 working days for the refund now. I asked to talk to a manager because at this point it must have been around October 21st. The first time they refused, so I called straight back and I finally got talking with the manager, she opened a complaint for me and said she would call me back when the final bill was generated. On October 31st, I got a phone call from the same manager, who reassured me that the final bill had been generated a couple of days prior, and I should wait 7 working days from then. She immediately closed my complaint and said she had 'solved my issue,' to which I mentioned I wanted it kept open until I had received my refund, but she wouldn't let me. So my complaint was closed, and I was told around November  3rd that I would receive my refund, she was adamant about this. So I thought, being a manager, she would know best! I waited until November 3rd, but nothing. I called back and got put through to an operator who was working on the billing/technical side of things. He told me that my account had been cancelled, but nobody ever cancelled my contract. I must have called at least 15-20 times in total, being told the same lies. So FINALLY, after all of these calls, somebody took the time to look into this for me and found out why this kept happening. He cancelled my contract, and this time I actually got an email saying this was done! From then, he told me to wait 7 working days from then, and it should be in my account. Eventually, it happened, on November 5th, I received my refund, and the emails and letters seemed to have stopped too. I just find it hard to believe, that not one other person decided to look into the query far enough for me to actually get a resolution, it took me over a month. I probably spent a total of 5 hours on the phone, trying to find my answer, but got dismissed every time. In addition, when I persisted in telling the operators that I wanted the problem resolved, they began speaking over me in a condescending manner - saying 'Just wait another 7 days' or telling me I was just straight up wrong.Moral of the story: You will have to go through at least 20 different advisors and wait months to obtain your answer, so unless you are certain there won't be any issues at all, AVOID doing business with Three! # The WORST experience I've ever had with a company.",Negative,-0.033679654

Here's my story: More than two weeks ago I requested the porting of my EE number to Three via an online form. Although my EE sim got deactivated on the day the number porting was supposed to happen, my EE number had not ported to my Three sim. I've chatted with multiple agents via Three's website chat as well as on the phone and they keep saying that they've forwarded my query to a specialised team which will get back to me with updates in 72 hours. More than TWO WEEKS have passed and I still don't have access to my number. My number got cancelled on EE's end so there's no way they could reactivate it or issue me with a new PAC code to try switching again. Three's support has been very incompetent and very inconsistent. Sometimes they tell me the porting got cancelled and my number is not with them so EE should be able to help, while on other occasions they tell me the porting got stuck and they are working on it. Although clearly they cannot resolve my issue, they refuse to issue me a deadlock letter so that I can escalate things with the Ombudsman sooner rather than later.

Never heard back so we got in touch again and got told that he had used all the data (90gb data) in 24 hours and ‘they do not do refunds’ was repeated by Karthik over and over again. Extremely unprofessional and rude. There is no chance anyone can use that much data in a day? We asked how it’s possible and he kept replying I’ve already told you, when he hadn’t explained anything. My partner is at work all day and barely uses his phone he had topped up a lot as his original top up had also failed. They owe him nearly £40 and their only reply is ‘we don’t do refunds’.

Three,4,GB,1,My experience of Three so far,03-Nov-23,e9126c13-3bcf-4b1b-a8ea-4dae88e0c42d,"Where do I start,Firstly my virgin media contract is due for renewal so I though I'd shop around.No other provider comes close to speeds but I thought I'd give three a go with a 5g router.Entered a contract on Thursday 02.11.23 around 6.30pm and sure enough package arrived next day.This is when it turned into a pickle.So Friday, the package arrives around 2-3 hours later than projected, but! Excited to try, I whip out the package stick in my sim and turn it on, let's say the lights are pretty at this point. Sits down and waits, logs into the WiFi and no Internet. Waits some more. Nothing!Faffs about with it and then decided to contact three and speak with an advisor called Aseem, after nearly 2hours of waiting and communicating, I established it won't be on that day, but any issues with services would be escalated and it should be on the following day.This is far from the advertised insert your aim and turn me on. But OK an evening won't harm I've got my existing Internet provider working perfectly fine.Accepting of the advisors expectations I wait until Saturday.Sure enough turn the router back on nothing. Turn it off then tried again in the afternoon. Still nothing! So I contact Three again. Another hour wasted speaking with Ayush this time. Who advised I must wait until after 72hours for services to be provided due to a technical issue.At this point I'm thinking 5 days without a service. So as a brand new customer with a poor service provided I have invoked my cancellation right as this is not a service i want to receive. At this point I'm informed to make contact after services are provided. Here's where it gets funny:I've a minimum 30 day contract, no phone number as its a router sim and no service, I'm told I have the privilege to cancel 30 days after the device is received.I have formally informed the advisor i am cancelling today and i want returns envelope. I was told this cannot happen until Three provide the service, this sounds ridiculous, if I was in a catchment area Three couldn't service then I could cancel right away, right?I have a device with no service and have to wait 5 days for it to be activated. Only then i can contact three to cancel is ludicrous.I have informed the agent I have no intention to contact after today, but I'm informed I must contact after 72hours or risk being charged for the service ongoing.As it stands I have wasted far too much time with Three and fear I'll be charged for a non existent service.  In addition Three is a very apt name here, as I'll no doubt be contact three, three times (third time) after 72hours to cancel as I have zero confidence in any of their services.Note the advisor confirmed this level of techincal hitch and service happens occasionally. I'll come back and edit, once I have an outcome.Also do not contact this thread with a hollow we're sorry blah blah.My order number is 184984762A, contact me if you really want to fix this. # My experience of Three so far",Positive,0.051222583

I have had to tell our accountants to just forget about Three and invoices - we would get more information out of the Almighty than we will out of Three. Sorry but I have lost it with Three.

The late payments and loan listed on my credit history are making it extremely difficult for me to secure a mortgage. And pushing up the interest rates. Three's failing to investigate and resolve the fraud in a timely manner is causing me much stress, delay in purchasing a house and hundreds of pounds due to higher interest rates from mortgage lenders.

He went out of his way to get me the best deals, even when other sales people had no time and were a little rude, he was extremely helpful and went out of his way to ensure my deal didn't 'run out the next day' like some 3 members had said, and he was patient and got me some excellent price reductions. I'm actually sad to be leaving three, but I wanted my phone before going on holiday so decided to go for the phone I wanted in stock elsewhere.

According to s62(1)(2) of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, I cannot be bound by contractual terms after the expiration of the contractual agreement. My contract ended in October and I fulfilled my obligation fully. Therefore, RONIT was not doing me a favour as he suggested during our telephone conversation. I am not bound by any contractual terms and 3 mobile is not doing me a favour if I state emphatically that you will not receive a payment of £53. Consequently, I am at liberty to stop paying a direct debit that was set up for the contractual period. Do not treat your customers as though they lack common sense and some actually know the law. The 'hard sell' approach must be used tactfully and not forcibly if even at all. Telling all your customer services representatives to sing the same song does not negate the legislative provision enshrined in the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

Copious hours spent on web chat because it’s near enough impossible to speak to a human on the phone, which they’ve done a great job of ensuring (the bot will just straight up hang up on you if options run out). Passed through multiple teams, and people, who all take you through the same standard checks and never read the previous conversations, but always apologise about the inconvenience caused (try days of no internet, needed to do your job) - you literally go around in circles repeating yourself. Strangely, no one has the slightest clue what’s going on, considering the service you have paid for is not working. Go in store and it’s just a vast sea of helpers that can’t actually help at all, they’re just there to sell you stuff and shrug when you need actual support. You are guided to, again, spend hours of your time on hold before speaking to their ‘tech teams’ on their store phone. A small success, if you like, the fact they can get you through to a real human. The most they’ll do is ring them up, then pass you the phone to sit on hold in their noisy store, filled with angry people complaining, which makes you actually value and long for the web chat again.. one minute you’re told it’s a wider issue and ‘many customers are experiencing the same thing’, and the next your retelling the issue for the seventh time to yet another person, who’s none the wiser of any widespread issues, and requesting to run pointless tests you’ve already done for the millionth time. Then, finally, after the tests don’t work (shock) you get told that there’s ‘a network development happening in your area which will last until the end of November’, and basically there’s nothing you can do, so they suggest you wait it out. Look on the Three network checker in the area and guess what - excellent service with no planned maintenance.When I ask to be reimbursed for not being able to use the data packed I’ve paid for, I’m literally laughed at in store and told “that’s not going to happen, sir”. Complaints manager on web chat tells me after (again) having to explain and justify why, they’ll refund me £10 as an absolute “good will gesture and exemption that’s a one off and won’t happen again”. I wish this was an exaggeration, but unfortunately, it’s not. Thank GOD Im not in a contract with this company..Reading through the comments, it’s likely someone from Three will reply to this with something like ‘Oh no!

At the end of this contract they sent renewal options that were so much more expensive than other companies readily available.  After asking for a PAC to move to another provider they then sent an offer that was more reasonable (but not great!).  If they had sent this option straight away maybe I would have considered staying.Have moved to a new provider - cheaper but also provides roaming for Europe included in the price.They should consider bringing back roaming - particularly to cover the rest of the world at a more reasonable price.Really not very happy with the value for money. # Long term Three UK customer,Positive,0.130608117
Three,5,GB,1,Shambolic Customer Service.,23-Oct-23,ac5be28a-24a4-4d45-8008-df00d2038211,"I originally purchased a sim card for a second hand phone from Three just over a year ago. Unfortunately the phone packed up so I approached Three to see what deals they can do me on a cheap Android phone. The sales representative I spoke to was really unprofessional, there were jokes being told in the background of the call centre which she was laughing at while trying to serve me and at some points put me on hold to have a proper laugh. The whole call took over an hour! Once I picked a phone I was told there would be an early upgrade fee of £266 as I was still in contract however as an act of ‘good will’ it would be refunded within a few days. Stupidly I gave her my credit card number to take the payment. The phone arrived OK however when I checked my card statement at the end of the month there was no refund. I called the Three billing team who assured me it would be refunded in 7 days. Of course after 7 days there was no refund so I had to call again (each time having to wait for the call to be answered for 20 minutes) This time I was told that the original sales advisor I spoke to about the upgrade would have to OK the refund, this obviously didn’t fill me with much hope! I got a call back a day later to say the refund had been approved and I would receive the money in 7 days. So, guess what! After 7 days still NO REFUND! I called Three billing team again and was told that the wrong ‘refund code’ had been used on the request so the billing team rejected it. The agent I spoke to said he had to reapply the refund on the account to OK the refund and I would receive it in another 7 days! So here I am a couple of days after the last call and still no refund. I have honestly never known anything like it, there was no apology and no offer of compensation. If you are looking to get a phone or sim car with Three - DON’T!

Three,7,GB,1,Totally inept- would give zero stars if possible,31-Oct-23,1299f196-0f37-4b68-ba15-04523780800e,"We have been business customers with Three for almost 15 years. For most of that time the service has been gone, hence renewing each device with them, however over the past 12-18 months the service has become truly awful. The customer advisors are simply clueless. They are only capable of reading scripted answers and are completely unable to resolve even basic queries or technical issues. As a result, these very simply issues do not get resolved. We upgraded our final device with Three about 12 months ago. After confirming the address each time we were transferred from idiot to idiot, we finally gave the delivery address to the final customer ""service"" advisor. The following day we received the text/ email from the courier to say they had sent the device to an old residential address none of our staff had lived in for over 5 years! After another battle to try to speak to anyone with an ounce of common sense (reader, there is NOBODY with an ounce of common sense!) we were told we would have to wait for the device to be returned before it could be resent leaving a member of staff with no phone for almost 2 weeks. Once again, attempting to resolve this with Three was impossible. Finally, I have been experiencing service issues with my device. I have attempted to discuss and resolve this with the customer service team but it is a complete waste of time. The team simply do not have a clue and as such I currently have a device which is unuseable for much of the time. I have attempted to raise this with the Three team however this has just been a complete waste of my time. I have also attempted to raise as a complaint on 3 separate occasions. Each time these complaints simply go unanswered. Following the final effort I phoned to chase the progress and was told Three do not have a complaints team! I have been promised a phone call back by the advisor twice (hasn't happened) and their manager on Friday or Monday (again hasn't happened) which gives an idea of the ineptitude within Three. I am sure I will get a reply directing me to their webchat team, however having already tried to deal with this team on several occasions, i will not be bothering again. This is simply the same people who are the phone support on their laptops (assuming they can even manage to turn these on!)In summary - completely avoid Three.

Three,4,GB,1,Absolutely awful dealing with 3,28-Oct-23,ddeb3190-4b17-43b1-927e-3d391cd05c00,"Absolutely awful dealing with 3. I am an existing customer with 4 separate contracts for my family. Trying to find out if my account is set up for use of phone & data in France. Have rang 5 times today and cannot get past the auto system to speak to a human being to find out. Same thing when I went abroad earlier this year, account & phone says I was set up ok only to find I couldn't use my phone when I got there & had to buy an add on via the hotel free wifi. Can't wait for my contracts to run down so I can dump this dreadful provider.UPDATETried again & on the 6th call I chose the options as if I was going to buy a new phone, this got me in contact with a human fairly quickly & then I explained what I was looking for. They told me I was connected to the wrong dept (obviously!) but would transfer me to the correct dept. I was then connected to an extremely helpful person who was able to assist. After checking, they confirmed I had all the correct set up & add ons for calls & data use abroad, only to then tell me they had made a mistake & needed to buy an add on for my wifes phone, After agreeing to this & getting this set up, they said I was all set up to on my phone & my wife & sons phone. As we were wrapping up the call, she said she had made a mistake & needed to change a setting in my account or they wouldn’t work. Eventually we appear to be set up & the call centre staff were really helpful, but it took 6 calls & just short of an hour on the phone to sort a simple thing out. It is worth noting that according to the 3 app, my account & settings were already all set up for roaming use in Europe, when in reality it needed a further setting adjustment by customer service to actually allow this to work. We go to Disneyland Paris in 7 days time. I am not optimistic that our phones will work abroad. Our flight tickets, rail tickets, hotel reservation, restaurant reservations & event tickets are all online & without roaming data, these will not be accessible. I will be have to print & bring paper copies as back up for everything. It’s been a very difficult & stressful morning on the phone trying to get through the endless levels of the auto options to eventually end up being cut off with a recorded ‘goodbye’ message 5 times & having to start again. It’s also extremely poor that via the app, my account was supposedly all set up for roaming, when it turns out another mystery setting, only accessible by 3 customer services, needed to be amended. Overall just another awful Three experience & I look forward to the day I will be taking my family’s 4 contracts elsewhere.Update 2- 03/11/23. Arrived in France & pretty much as expected, our roaming data didn’t work. Had to call 3 support again whilst at the airport. Total nightmare getting through the auto system to speak to someone, AGAIN, eventually got sorted having found out that the spend cap had not actually been removed, despite being told explicitly during my previous tech support calls to 3 that this was all set so that we could get mobile data as soon as we landed. Altogether, this has taken 7 calls & 136 minutes to 3 tech support to resolve a very basic service, which, by the way,  I am also paying extra for. I have already received an apology reply to my original & first update posts above, but in all sincerity, I have had more than enough of your rubbish service 3. Constantly poor service followed by an apology is no way to run a business & keep customers. I have been with 3 for around 10 years, currently have 4 contracts with them, but its clearly time to find another provider. # Absolutely awful dealing with 3",Negative,-0.037550505

First off I bought a phone on their website, it was a payg phone and I spent t a lot of money on it. I got it delivered. I realized the phone after opening it, it was heating up. I wasn't a fan of it so I contacted three to return as it was within the 14 day cooling off period. It's now been another week and the 14 day cooling off period has passed. Three do not have a policy in place to return PAYG phones. This does not trump my rights to a 14 day return. I had recorded all my calls with three and notified them of this too. To cut a long story short, I spoke with a manager and he promised me to send a returns DPD abel to my email within 1-2 days so I can then send it back for a refund. That was on Tuesday and it's now Saturday and still haven't received it. I will be taking legal action against THREE.CO.UK. How dare they ignore my requests and break their terms and conditions.

When trying to log on to my account or contact three I am always met with unpleasant or even harassing experiences. When trying to cancel an add-on, the most basic action on an online interface, it is impossible to do without once again wasting copious amounts of time and energy as it is a feature that is not available, although the purchasing of an add-on is constantly shoved in your face. This company seriously lacks any sense of morality and transparency and I cannot wait to leave. As someone currently abroad and paying for a contract and add-ons they do not require, I am simply disgusted.

For some reason the service did work for a few days but now back to the square one. I have just switched from O2 as 3 had better coverage but this is the biggest mistake. What a lousy service.....and please, 3, do not ask me to waste more of my valuable holiday ""chatting"" to a usless service team who have not been able to solve the problem. Their last ""Gem"" of knowledge was to swap the sim into another phone. What a waste of time that was!

Well, this time only 1hr and 14 mins and 3 different agents. Would have been 4 however they disconnected the chat waiting on complaints (they were busy - wonder why?).Finally agreed I don't have the iPhone 14 however the only help they could provide me is another sim-only contract. Not PAYG but another contract. Wouldnt allow me to cancel as said the contract was taken out in July with the phone and its still valid for sim-only.Please don't expect any help from the people from three who respond to these, they can't or won't help you.I have now had to cancel the DD mandate as they are due to take £1100 for a phone they failed to deliver.I have a suspicion this company is in real trouble.

He couldn’t match the uswitch deal either and claimed that I was lose my number but this is not true- there is a way of being able to keep your number with three it’s just a longer route but I was happy to take that. He didn’t want to even discuss that route let alone mislead me into thinking I could lose my number- because of this I felt forced to take on a contract I wasn’t happy with especially a long three year contract. I expressed most of my concerns but he still couldn’t provide good service, all he cared about was that I had a good credit score so he could be successful in securing a contract. A business model like three thrives on people who are returning customers and who have good credit scores so why not provide the best service to keep your clients happy? Why not value your long standing customers? There are lot of people who cannot continue to pay their bills and phone service is barred but I’ve always paid mine on time with three so why not appreciate the returning client?

We had two mobile broadband contracts with Three due to a lack of fibre broadband in our area. This has recently changed and I therefore wanted to cancel both contracts. Both were out of their fixed contract period and so had a 30 day cancellation policy. When I cancelled the first contract I was told sternly that I had 5 days after the end of the contract to return the router otherwise I would be charged 150 pounds. Two weeks after the cancellation was made I received an email lambasting me for not having returned the router (three weeks early at that stage). I called customer service and was told again that it only needed to be returned 5 days after the contract ended. I returned the first router earlier this week, well ahead of the contract end only to receive another stern email informing me that as it had been 30 days since my cancellation and as I had not returned my router the contract would continue. When I called Customer service again to query this I was told that in contradiction to this last email the account has been closed but they were not able to confirm this in writing.  They could not explain why I received the email. Clearly the automatic email system is not aligned to the actual rules. Customer service is unable to help.

DO NOT GIVE YOUR INFORMATION TO THREE UK.A fraudulent pay monthly account was opened in my name, using my home address but an incorrect date of birth. Fortunately the fraudulent account was not using my bank account details. I spent in excess of 5 hours trying to report the fraud. The level of incompetence from Three UK is truly incomprehensible. Every single customer service agent told me different things and numerous hung up the phone. You should make it easier to report fraud and follow proper ID security checks and bank/name matching check to stop this happening. If you had checked my credit file properly, you would have noticed that the date of birth did not match. In addition, if you had checked the bank account properly you would have noticed that the account details did not match. As a result of these security issues, I would advise that you do not sign up with Three UK, as they do not have adequate security measure in place. And if they cannot follow this simple process, how can they keep your data safe. As a result of Three UKs incompetence, I am now paying a monthly subscription on each of my credit files to monitor my credit reports. It took months for Three UK to actually except this as a fraudulent account and action closing it. I received a non personalised standard closure letter with general information. Three UK will try to tell you that this is an isolated incident, but just Google Three UK IDENTITY fraud and you will see that this issue has affected a large number of people and has been happening for a very long time. I have contacted my local MP about this, I would advise anyone else who has been affected by this organisation incompetence to do the same.

However if I emailed them a copy of my id to a central email I could then be told the upgrade options.

Firstly, they outsource all their customer service to India and they do a terrible job. Whatever systems they have in place were designed by toddlers. They'll constantly transfer you to different teams but won't update the other team with your info so you have to explain everything again.

When I offered to provide evidence they gave me wrong email twice. Also, whenever I ask for an email mentioning my bills and details they say chat transcript is the evidence. No email no doc nothing. Shady as expected. Now they are trying to charge me a cancellation fee that was waived. Keep saying we promise it will be adjusted like they have been doing and saying since last month. Still, I had to request adjustment. My app is still showing a wrong bill, nobody updates it although I was assured it will take 48 hours. Now they are telling me it will be updated next month. Shady again. Two times two different things being said. These chat transcript promises seem fake now. Someone literally updated my bill within 5mins last month. Why can't the same be done?  I feel like my money will be taken from aciunt and it's just a plan of 3. It takes a whole month to prove that my fee was waived. I think it will take me to literally go to my grave to get money back once it is taken.I filled in a complain form and got no reply.

Big mistake. Firstly, the brand new Samsung Galaxy S23 has overheated from day one. I tried to contact them but was responded to by a bot pretending to be human who told me that my problem could not be resolved. This was really bad timing as I was leaving for South Africa for a month and had a lot to do in the week or so before departure and I really just didn't get back round to trying to escalate the issue.I activated roaming before I left the UK but it is NOT working. It has not worked at all. I turned roaming off and back on. No luck. It has meant I have missed messages and calls regarding financial transactions and has been a big, fat headache having to buy a local sim and notify people of the change of my WhatsApp number as I cannot get a code to activate my UK WhatsApp. On top of everything, I really wanted to get a screen protector fitted by Vodacom in South Africa as SA technology in this regard is miles ahead of the UK and they fit brilliant, soft and flexible screen protectors, not the great big thick ones provided by UK mobile phone providers. I have not dared to do so because I do not want to spend money on a phone I may not keep.As a reply - nothing to do with the cap on spend - I arrived back in the UK today - NO SERVICE. It was working when I departed on 1/10, it did not work from the miinute I left the UK and today it is still not working - even as I type this - and highly inconvenient when needing to make arrangements for Uber, or to be fetched from Heathrow particularly in this awful weather, it led to a lot of anxiety.

The Three branch in Edinburgh originally set up multiple accounts in my name by accident and took months to resolve the issue, in which time 100s of pounds were withdrawn from my account. Instead of solving the issue, the branch decided to give me 2 accounts, one business and 1 personal, to save their own skin. This was after a number of direct calls to the branch and customer services, as well as me receiving harassing calls from Three telling me I had not paid my bill. I had to take time out of work to constantly go in to the branch, as well as numerous weekends.My contract was to end in October 2023, but due to the branch staff's error, they have pushed this to January 2024 to account for the mistakes they made when setting up my account. Although I have visited the store in person and called multiple times, they have ignored the issue and refused to call me back. As a result of the numerous accounts in my name and the money withdrawn, Three have tanked my credit score and I have failed credit checks, meaning I cannot even get a new sim.

He questioned me about the race of the person I spoke to regarding the phone.  Tried to make it out that I was lying about the deal and asked me to prove that a dealt with the Honor 90 phone existed.  He then went on to essentially call me a liar and say no such request or deal existed.  He was ignorant and had no customer skills or knowledge.  He then went on to lie about the system and process of ordering a phone at Three.  Bilal should be fired from his position.  He was patronising and misogynistic in his communications with a female.

My two-year contract with Three ended last year, and I continued paying a monthly fee similar to what I used to pay for an Unlimited data plan. However, I ran into issues when my roaming data didn't work while travelling outside the UK, despite purchasing an additional roaming data package.To resolve this, I decided to upgrade my plan and sign up for another two-year contract. However, the process was anything but smooth. After waiting for two hours to connect with an online agent, I expressed my desire to upgrade to a plan similar to my husband's and retain my existing phone number. The agent advised me to get a new SIM card but assured me that I could transfer my old number to it.When the new SIM card arrived, I encountered issues while trying to complete the number transfer. When I contacted customer support online again, I was informed that I couldn't transfer my old number because it was already associated with Three. To make matters worse, I was told that I'd incur an exit fee if I wanted to cancel my contract. Frustrated, I had to speak to another agent as I didn't want to pay for two separate accounts, which meant reconfirming all my details. Eventually, we managed to resolve the issue.However, when I was transferred to a third agent to set up a new contract for my old number, I was told that my current account would be closed on that day, and I'd be charged for both contracts—the old and the new. At this point, I had already spent four hours dealing with customer support, and I decided to abandon the process. My old contract was supposed to remain valid until the 20th, and it was only the 3rd of October.Today, I went to a physical store to try and finalize the same deal. I was initially told to wait for 5-10 minutes, but I ended up waiting for a full 40 minutes. Frustrated, I decided to leave the store. Adding to my frustration, I saw two groups of people who arrived at the store after I had, despite sitting in front of a desk as instructed by the store manager. This experience left me feeling ignored and exhausted.The entire process I encountered with Three was not only tiresome but also poorly organized. It seemed that employees lacked proper training and communication. Due to this lengthy and unsatisfactory experience, I've decided that I can no longer continue with this company. I hope that in the future, Three will prioritize customer appreciation, improve internal communication, and strive for greater transparency. Until these improvements are made, I'll be seeking services elsewhere. # A never ending frustration",Negative,-0.019905303

Beginning of September I was pre warned of iPhone 15 introduction and also ore warned that as a reward for being long user of company I would soon be invited to an upgrade of my old new iPhone 14 pro max via trade in no money upfront worth up to £950 for selected iPhone models all of which I qualified for to operate this service you were advised to enter into A 24 or 36 months contract with the iphone 15 and also like wise a 24 or 36 month mobile service plan. On arrival of new phone the iME number from iphone 15 must be entered in old iphone after disabling find my iphone and securing your iCloud luggage this would then activate the promotional code set up by the threerecycle marketing department obviously In conjunction with the apple marketing department and the marketing department of mobile plans. This I thought perfect timing because I was hand picked first no money up front assured. Three refused to honour my invitation by demanding over £1000 up front. I explained he was wrong and that he was ignoring the design of the marketing scheme asking to be transferred to three recycle was unheard of escalation was honoured but the same denial of promotion persisted with a demand upfront for over £1000 . I refused the demand because I was already upgrading the iphone via a new contract so £1000 was just for fresh air that I could use.  I became suspicious and wondered how am I transferred to talking to cyber fraud gangsters from an official legitimate company business promotion. I told the last three complaints assistant Named Milan that I would not be funding guns and bombs. Not before telling him my work with an official marketing media company was as a mystery shopper and I have to report unethical sales back to my team. I also asked him was he aware of how many media services were a party to the promotion and that thousands of pounds were paid for the project to boost the economy he didn’t seem to think his actions would be affected by this .I also emailed the promotion email inviting me to this project he refused to care this left me believing this money was for a mega cause and money actual fiat cash is often needed in large quantities to unlock the blockchain involved in many bit coin spin off projects this money was recently being sort just before the reports of incredible activity with bitcoin being paid out to criminals. I asked him does he want three . co.uk to lose their license he demanded over a thousand pounds again before following procedure as described in the terms and conditions every time I mentioned it he demanded money up front again for a promotion clearly stating no money up front. I need to alert MARTYN LEWIS to this scam no one wants to be party to genocide and money being claimed is being used somewhere and it is no for good it is for evil .

Signed Ipsos mystery shopper all evidence kept no missed calls in last few days so three only called ever to collect thousand pounds and more pretty certain all recorded calls are lost.

I recently upgraded my contract with the understanding that I would not exceed a 30GB data usage limit and that my monthly usage typically remains within 20GB. However, my recent experience has left me feeling disheartened and frustrated.The issue I wish to address revolves around my data usage exceeding the 30GB limit and incurring unexpected charges. Despite being reassured by one of your representatives that this usage limit would be sufficient, I was astonished to find that I had gone over my data allowance and, as a result, had to pay an additional £5 for an extra gigabyte of data. This has not only disrupted my budget but has left me feeling misled and misinformed by your customer service team.What troubles me even more is that, when I attempted to resolve this issue through your customer service hotline, I was presented with limited options that only encouraged me to spend more money, disregarding the fact that my bill was already exceeding the budget I had carefully planned.I must express my disappointment with these circumstances, especially when I am aware that other networks are offering more cost-effective deals that better suit my needs.

Then finally I get a call, I had to keep repeating myself to different agents  because they would just keep transferring my calls to another department, and each time someone answers they wouldn't know whats the problem so I had to repeat myself. It doesn't end there! They keep promising to fix the issue but they fail to do so. Basically when I requested to cancel the contract, the employee wrote the reason for cancelation is a bad connection. But the truth is I never received any sim which means i never used the number.

However, I've had no problems with the network, and they've proven much better than the likes of 02/EE/Vodafone that my immediate family have used.

Thank you Eknath Chaudhary for dealing with my complaint & billing issue, I am happy with the waiver as a resolution & thank you for a quick response. I wasn’t that hopeful reading the on here but I am pleased to tell other customers my issue is now resolved & to advise to explain everything clearly with evidence & three will deal with your issue like they have done with mine. I understand systems & communications can get confused so I will put this down to that. Thank you Three for your understanding & I will continue the broadband service I have with you with no problems relating to service. I am writing this as I am getting nowhere with ThreeUK. I swapped from sky mobile to three a few months ago expecting the same coverage & service as I was receiving but it’s been shocking from day 1. First the sim order & delivery went perfect but unfortunately I had problems within 2 day with the mobile service & in particular the Apple Watch data plan wouldn’t connect whatever I tried so I asked to cancel within the 14 day cooling off period. The operator logged everything for customer service but nothing was actioned at all until I chased it up but then only the data plan was cancelled leaving me outside the 14 day cooling off period & stuck with a service that was shocking. The last 2 months I have repeatedly tried to speak to people using live chat only to be repeatedly cut off so nothing is ever resolved. I checked the consumer credit legal section for mobiles & found that if the service was like mine & it provable I didn’t receive the service I signed for I could leave. I again tried to do the live chat to be cut off 3 times so in the end I requested a PAC to go back to sky mobile but before I did I checked to see if that would be ok & I was given wrong information so I tried to cancel but again I was told as I had told sky to cancel come back the next day but by that time it was too late. Three have treated me really badly & the customer service people are on the most part polite but nothing seems to be resolved ever. I tried to cancel during 14 day cooling off but they didn’t do it & now I have received a final bill for £355.00!!I have asked the communication ombudsman to step in but not received a response yet although it’s been allocated to an officer but I would please like Three to respond properly to this & take action as I don’t want my credit negatively effected when it’s not my fault. Despite these negative I hope Three will prove they are able to correct their wrong when it’s genuine like this is. I will keep this updated.

However, when I checked for an update on September 26, I was informed that my order hadn't been processed, and the monthly cost was not £12, but an astonishing £29.Despite my attempts to sort out the issue, I ended up placing a second order, only to face the same problems with misinformation and discrepancies in the monthly cost. After wasting over 4 hours on the phone, I was assured that the system had been updated, and a discount applied, guaranteeing the correct £12 per month charge. Yet, the subsequent bill showed £33.80, not the agreed-upon £12.To add to the frustration, my partner's order, placed on the same day, hasn't been fulfilled. As of today, she has not received her SIM card. The attempts to resolve this have been equally infuriating.This experience with Three Mobile has been nothing short of a communication nightmare, marked by misleading information and an utter lack of transparency. As a customer, I expected clear and accurate details about the services I was purchasing, but the reality was far from it.The entire ordeal not only wasted an unreasonable amount of my time but also left me with a sense of frustration and regret. Based on my experience, I strongly advise others to think twice before opting for Three Mobile's services.

I spent 10 days in Tenerife without being able to use my phone as I couldn't contact them from a wireless network as chat wasn't available for outside UK.

I re-opened & never heard anything back. Then with their system change the link to my issue broke.Customer service (at least on on PAYG) is an utter joke - ONLY online chat, you cannot speak to anyone ever, and they are useless...cannot fix anything and then cut off the chat when they can't.The recent (Sept 2023) system changes/update has been a total disaster. First my auto renew data pack expired after 2 days (expired when they did the overnight changes) - three hrs on chat to customer service the guy could not fix and just said I had no auto renew...by chance I got a text saying my auto renew had just gone through & I had data etc again, but the Cx service guy was STILL saying I didnt!!Then a few days later I got a text saying their system updates had finished, from which point I lost my unlimited minutes, I could not even call Three voicemail, but still had data thankfully, but also since then I cannot access my account either online or on the app (which I had updated to the latest as well).Three also has a terribly slow service no matter where I am and even when I have a full 4G+ signal I get 2-3 Mbps max.

I recently discovered that when I upgraded my contract last year that the old contract was never cancelled so have been charged twice each month for almost a year - accidents happen, so this isn’t my problem. My problem is I have phoned 5 times now and each time have been on the phone for 45 minutes each time as I am constantly being transferred to the next advisor until I get someone who can actually be bothered to entertain the problem. Every time I have been assured that I am entitled to a full refund and I will be called right back as soon as they get confirmation from their manager and absolutely nothing happens. They are doing absolutely everything they can to avoid paying back the money they have admitted 5 times they owe me.I’m response to three’s response-The fact you have ignored the fact that every one of your advisors have admitted I am due a refund shows you really haven’t looked into this claim or the situation and shows your unprofessionalism. As previously stated, my issue isn’t that there was a mistake on your employees part that didn’t cancel my previous contract or upgrade me as asked, my issue is the shear lack of care and customer service on your part in resolving this issue. I have been promised refunds and calls back numerous times and nothing has happened. I have been told I am due a refund numerous times and have not received it so yes, my previous statement is true.

Three,2,GB,1,A timeline of my terrible experience,25-Sep-23,ea42cacc-b94e-47bb-921d-48844ceee54d,"I've had some terrible experiences with companies before but Three has been the worst without doubt. Instead of using colorful language to explain my issue, I'll just present a timeline with solid dates and let you judge for yourself. - I signed a 2 year 5G contract with Three in October 2022 and tested their speeds and verified it's all fine. - In July 2023, my partner noticed that the internet speed was gating her work and speed tests showed only 60MB/S Download and 2MB/S upload on Ethernet which is way less than promised. - Reported the issue in last week of July and one week later, the technical team explained that there's an issue in our area and they have no idea when it will be fixed. Also, that issue has been there since May but we didn't notice it. The Technical Team offered to cancel our contract and waive the fees which we gladly accepted. - 2 Days later I called again to verify as no email was received. The Cancellation team had no idea about my cancellation and after an hour of talking nothing happened. I hanged up and called again but went to the Technical Team and voila ! They know. They promised the return package will be sent within 72 hours. LESSON ONE: Different teams in Three has no idea about anything related to your issue and can't really check it cause they are not allowed to see that info (As explained in one of the calls). - It took 3 weeks and about 7 calls each at least half an hour and always involves the agent having no idea what I'm talking about or saying that the previous request was not done properly to finally get my return envelope. When I got it, I received three of them! - During these three weeks, the one time I received help was from the complaints team who asked me to cancel my direct debit and gave me 2 months of credit till the return has been sorted. LESSON TWO: With Three, people who can really help are the complaints team but you'll be allowed to speak with them only after you've rejected the nonesense solution provided by other teams and insisted to talk to the complaints team. - I packed my device and sent it back on the 20th of August. It arrived on the 21st as per the tracking number. - Few days later my account was still open so I called to enquire and they have no idea that my device was returned. A ticket was filed to trace the device along with the tracking number. - One month later and about 5-7 calls and chats and my device was still not found. Again, everytime the agent has no idea about my issue and everytime they say they'll raise a request. I've given the tracking number so many times that I memorised it. - Finally, the solution came from the complaints team again. It's not that they found my device, it's just the agent offered to just cancel the contract and waive all the fees as promised. I went for dinner to celebrate! My conclusion, I understand why is Three charging very less for their services. They provide little to no actual support and when their service breaks down they don't even fix it. I don't blame the dozen or more agents I've chatted with, they were all polite and professional but I can see that they really have no way to help me. Three hires lots of agents in low cost geo zone to save cost but they don't really have anyone here to send a return envelope or verify that a device has been returned.

It was gloriously economical and suited me perfectly as most of that was spent stuck in call queues. But then they ended it some years ago and forced me onto the 35p a minute, 15p a text, 10p a MB tariff. When I enquired, I was told that the rates had to go up because they built 5G in my area--even though I'd hardly ever used data.Today, I get a text telling me that I hadn't used my PAYG account in a while and it would be closed if I don't spend money with them within the next 7 days. I paid £5 to top-up so that I can keep my number. I very much still use it for emergencies and 2FA.I wish Three would go back to the 321 PAYG tariff.

So unless you only plan on browsing the internet and watching YouTube, it’s a complete waste of money.Then there is the customer service…I had to make a total of 5 phones calls all lasting a minimum of 40 minutes each and everything about them is difficult.For starters, you can’t find your home broadband phone number as they don’t supply you with one. Which means you can’t use the online cancellation form to send it back.When you ring them they’re difficult to understand and if you can convince them to cancel, they don’t ever send you out the return label or collection bag in the post.The only way I found I could get through to them was to raise a complaint and then they took it more seriously. So when I finally managed to get a hold of a return label and sent it back, I mysteriously got multiple emails saying it’s been a whilst since we’ve heard from you and stating “you’ve missed the 30 day deadline to return your mobile broadband router.” To which I then had to make multiple calls again to rectify this.Even if this service worked well, I refuse to ever use Three and their so called “customer service” again! # Honestly the worst company I’ve ever dealt with…",Negative,-0.096527778

I have managed to resolve this with all of them - except Three.I informed Three of this Fraud, by phone, two months ago. It was not followed up on, despite promises it would be dealt with by ""the correct department"".Then, a few weeks ago, I receive a letter from debt collectors (issued and organised by Three) threatening to collect the debt (and more), unpaid from 'my' account.I wrote to Three's complaints department immediately, saying how distressing this was and to ask why they haven't investigated it, as instructed. My responses, were utterly pathetic - they may as well have been written by a BOT. Maybe they were. They didn't address the fraudulent account set up in my name at all - instead all I got was a generic response just asking me to go to a Three store to access 'my' Three account. As if it was actually mine!It seems like they do not even have a Fraud department, as no mention has been given to this being sent there. They have shown no interest at all, despite my repeated attempts to get them to investigate this - instead they seem happy to instruct debt collectors to take money from me, when this account has absolutely no connection to me whatsoever.I am left with no other option than to take legal action against Three themselves, as their refusal to investigate fraud is not legal (I have been told). This is underway. It is ridiculous that I am having to do this, as a way of protecting myself.I have also managed to arrange for a journalist friend (from a major newspaper) to expose Three's malpractices.  It may not end there, either.Even though I am not (nor will ever be) a Three customer, this is atrocious negligent practice. Not only is it seemingly very easy to get past Three's fraud checks to set up a fake account, but they obviously also don't care a jot for the resultant victims.I would avoid Three at all costs.

I did this.I then received another email from their debt collectors saying I still owed money, despite my having cleared the outstanding balance.

I was told I had!!!Promised a copy email within 48 hours.

They don't seem to understand that I can't pay a bill which they never sent me. Why should my credit rating suffer due to their incompetence? Words cannot express my utter disgust.UPDATE (29th October 2023) - so, I have paid everything and the account with Three is now settled and closed, YET - their debt collectors (CRS) are still texting me about monies owed and according to the Three agent who I just spoke to, it is I (the customer) who has to resolve this with the debt collectors and not Three (the company) who put them onto me in the first place. I am so looking forward to putting my complaint into the Ombudsman.Final UPDATE: Three removed the late payments from my credit file and paid me compensation after I got the Ombudsman involved. Go through the proper channels and Three will back down in the end. It's a shame that customers have to do this but I would like to thank the Ombudsman for getting things sorted.

Three,3,GB,1,Do not risk Three – from an 8+ year customer,27-Sep-23,05d9b4bb-437f-4bd4-a11c-349051daa4de,"Unbelievably useless. I've been with Three for ages and I have no idea why. There's no advantage. Took out a new Sim-only contract recently after a more pricey handset-included contract ran out. Took absolutely ages of bartering with several people to get a competitive price on the new one, and was originally offered one more expensive than EE, a much more reliable and reputable network. OK cool, so I finally got a decent price.This month – 2 months after I signed the contract – and they've been charging me the amount of my previous contract including an iPhone. I call them, and of course it's taken ages to get through to anyone as it does with any network (unless you press for upgrades, when you get through to someone immediately). They try to tell me it's all above board (no, it isn't), before changing the story and getting into how it's a billings error with no apology for the fact I've been charged 26 quid extra for the month? This is followed by endless blame passing between teams set to the music you hear in Superdrug. So many contradicting excuses/reasons for why I've been charged what on certain dates. After an excruciatingly long call, they have the cheek to end all of this with trying to upsell me onto a new handset contract! In the end, I just gave up because of how complicated they made everything (how my ""account was credited for X month, but then that rolled onto the next month, so the credit for this month will cover next month""... after an hour it's unbearable). Their call team based in India (in Mumbai and Pune, I believe?) are always friendly and reasonable (if desperate to upsell), and I don't consider the blame-passing/time-taking their fault. It's a UK company making shedloads of money, and the annoyances for the customer that come from exploiting the cheap labour of another nation are the responsibility of Three's senior leadership team.

Or you can avoid that by chatting online to their unbelievably slow operators (probably overworked dealing with too many customers at the same time as 3 is not willing to invest in customer support) who take ages to answer you but cut you off if you don't answer them within a couple of minutes.So, it's been impossible to get through to them.  I have no idea how I can speak to someone who can actually help, without clearing a whole day to do it, which I'm not willing or able to do.  And the whole experience is really stressful.  So I've spend the whole afternoon trying to sort out an issue that they created, but continuing to charge me after I switched away from them.  I spoke to them about it before and they acknowledged their mistake and told me there was nothing for me to worry about and no more bills would arrive.  But they keep coming.  They are worse than awful!!I've just seen 3's recent responses to other people who have had very similar experiences.  They seem to think that the solution to an unusable chat system is to ask people who complain about it to join a chat to talk about it some more.  This is a perfect example of what makes 3 so bad.UPDATE - As expected, they sent the same template response to me that they use for others.  I did decide to give it a go and see if their dedicated speedy resolution service could work.  Unfortunately, it was a much worse experience - after 20 minutes the advisor disappeared due to a ""technical difficulty"" and another came, who took ages to ""review the whole case"" but clearly hadn't as she didn't know the most basic details of it.  She repeatedly ignored my questions, repeatedly asked for information that I'd given several times, and after more than an hour, told me I should phone the phone number that I'd started with to try and sort out this problem weeks ago.  It had come full circle.  I previously said that zero stars would be appropriate, but now I think that would be unthinkably generous.  This problem is unresolved, and I have no way of trying to resolve it without throwing masses of time and patience (and I don't have either) at it for most probably no results whatsoever.  I'm really worried how this will escalate.  Either I'll have to pay them the money that they're not entitled to but keep demanding, or fight this injustice and have it take up a huge part of my life.

Three,1,GB,1,Disappointing,25-Sep-23,64806ee2-28a4-4955-ad22-c467a7678722,"I have been a loyal Three customer for both mobile and broadband services, but unfortunately, my experience with them has been far from satisfactory. Here's a detailed of my journey with Three:1. Mobile Network Coverage in Central London:One of the most frustrating aspects of being a Three customer is the poor mobile network coverage in central London. Surprisingly, in the heart of a major metropolitan area, I often find myself without a signal or unable to send images. This issue is particularly inconvenient in today's digital age, where staying connected is crucial. Three's mobile network needs significant improvement in central London to provide a reliable service.2. Unreasonable Termination Fees for Broadband:Recently, I encountered an unforeseen issue with my Three broadband service and decided to switch providers. To my shock, Three demanded a termination fee of £365, which I found to be exorbitant and unjust. This high fee left a bitter taste in my mouth and further soured my overall experience with the company. Transparent and reasonable termination policies are essential for retaining customer trust.3. Unhelpful and Unfriendly Online Customer Service:Attempting to resolve issues with Three's customer service team online was a frustrating experience. The representatives I interacted with were not only unhelpful but also displayed a complete lack of friendliness. It felt as if they were indifferent to my concerns and unwilling to assist me in any meaningful way. A company's customer service team should be empathetic and efficient, which regrettably did not seem to be the case with Three.In conclusion, while I have been a loyal Three customer for both mobile and broadband services, I cannot help but feel disappointed by the overall customer experience. The inadequate mobile network coverage in central London, unreasonable termination fees for broadband, and the unhelpful and unfriendly online customer service have all contributed to my frustration. It is my hope that Three takes these concerns seriously and makes the necessary improvements to provide a better customer journey in the future. # Disappointing",Negative,-0.01629386

I had awful signal from day one of my contract and was unable to make or receive calls, and was told they could do nothing about it as it was a signal fault in my area so I requested to come out of my contract as I was not getting the service I purchased. They wanted me to still pay 80% of my cancellation fee which I refused as the reason I was leaving was through a fault of theirs not mine. They eventually agreed to let me leave with no cancellation fee. However, I then got a bill saying I would be charged £303.47. I queried this twice on their online chat to make sure this would not come out of my account and was assured both times to ignore it and I would not be billed.The £303 was then taken out of my account. I had other bills to pay, direct debits due to go out, and other things I needed the money for. I was told I had to wait 7 days for it to be refunded. This has put me in such a tricky position as that is a large amount of money to be taken in error. I went into my overdraft and had to borrow money because of this. I raised it with them again and said I expected extra compensation due to the stress and inconvenience but the staff just kept saying ""you will be refunded don't worry"". A refund is not enough in this scenario but it got to the point that it was so frustrating to make progress with the customer service team that I gave up attempting. It is a breach of Ofcom rules to bill customers incorrectly this way. Companies have been fined millions of pounds for doing this to customers.

They were the first to do so, and openreach hadn't bothered with fibre and nobody else wanted to give us fibre. So three was my only choice for broadband faster than 60mbit DSL. I leapt to it and bought a top of the line Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 router which cost a lot. It was great, I was regularly seeing speeds in excess of 600 mbit and I got a real IP and no CGNAT and I was a very happy customer. 3 years later and i'm getting 6mbit. I'm not exaggerating, I'm not joking, 6mbit 5G. I can see my modem has a good strong signal, 4G + 5G and the speeds are less than 10mbit and sometimes even less than 1mbit on the upload. Whenever I call or online chat they say oh nothing is wrong with our network, it must be your equipment. Yet my equipment is in the loft, in the same place it's always been and I don't move it around it stays in the same place. Then all of a sudden, mostly late at night, it will start doing speeds of up to 100mbit, then it's back down to 6mbit during the day time again. I'm quite sure three are reducing speeds and im sure there is a problem in my area but they don't admit it. Their online help is no help at all. I'm paying for it, but I might as well not. I won't be renewing any of my four lines I have with three because they simply do not care. They sell you a service, and when it all goes to pot they pretend nothing is wrong and it must be you that's the problem not them. Fed up with it. Bought an O2 SIM and I now get 200mbit 5G. Three went from being brilliant, to bottom of the barrel. I didn't want to write this, but three are not interested in my problems and do nothing to fix it.Edit: So as per the reply from three, I contacted them on the link they provided, and I was given a phone number.

Three,11,GB,2,Problem with the time incoming calls go to voicemail,22-Sep-23,93e92186-75c4-4912-adfa-e0a845f1c168,"I have a problem with 3 voicemail. When someone calls my number and I don't answer the call will be forwarded to voicemail to enable the caller to leave me a message, which is fine. The problem with 3 voicemail is the length of time after starting the call that the caller can be passed to voicemail. I am told that the default of 30 seconds applies before the call is passed to voicemail. I have 2 problems with that:1 The maximum time for passing a call to voicemail is only 30 seconds. When I am away from home I will be carrying my handset with me either in my pocket or in a bag I am carrying. In that situation I know exactly where the phone is and I should normally have no problem in answering it within 30 seconds.However, when I am at home I will leave my phone somewhere around the house (eg by bedside, on a shelf or cupboard etc) and I will NOT normally carry it around the house. Therefore, if I receive a call the phone may be in another room or even on another floor and it will frequently take me more than 30 seconds to remember where it is and answer. I dislike missing calls this way and suggest the problem be solved by customers to be given an option for a longer time (I suggest up to 60 seconds) to answer the phone under these circumstances.2 The other problem is that the voicemail wait time can ONLY be changed by the customer calling 3 and speaking to support staff. Other phone companies I have used allow customers to change the wait time themselves, usually through calling voicemail and selecting an option to change the wait time. This normally only takes the customer a few seconds whereas being forced to call customer service usually takes very much longer  (maybe up to 30 minutes or so) which is a ridiculous waste of time.I called 3 today to discuss these problems (and the call took about 20 minutes) and spoke to a helpful member of staff calling herself Poojah. She understood my problem and agreed to raise this subject with management asking them to improve the voicemail service the way I have described above.Please can 3 introduce this significant improvement to their voicemail system? # Problem with the time incoming calls go to voicemail",Negative,-0.007878788

In my four-year tenure as a customer (from 2018 to now), I've had three contracts with them: one mobile plan and two broadband contracts.The trouble began when I requested the closure of the first broadband contract in January 2023. I promptly returned the device within five days of receiving the return label, even providing them with a tracking number as proof of shipment. Shockingly, they accused me of not returning the device and attempted to charge me £70. It wasn't until later that I discovered Royal Mail had lost their package, clearly not my fault, yet I was still being held responsible for their mistake.The issues didn't end there. They continued to bill me for the same broadband contract for three more months until June 2023, without refunding me for their mistake. Then, at the beginning of September, I asked to cancel both the remaining SIM plan and the second broadband contract. However, I had to follow up with them daily, and each time, the agent I spoke to claimed that no cancellation request had been submitted.As of now, I still haven't received confirmation that my contracts are canceled, and they consistently refuse to send follow-up emails after our discussions.

When I went to the live chat they refused to offer me a plan that was advertised online saying I had to have a new number/be a new customer. This has never been a problem in the past. I was then suggested two plans that were significantly more expensive with add ons I did not want or need. When we eventually settled on a plan I was asked multiple pieces of security information. In particular I was asked when my bank account opened and how long I have lived at my property which I have never needed to share before. There was no reassurance that the chat was a secure place to share this information and I was not happy proceeding. I was also told they would need details for a credit check. When I asked if it was a hard or soft credit check I was told it wasn’t a credit check. Later in the chat I was told it WAS a soft credit check (which is still a credit check!). When I asked to make a complaint I was told one would be logged but they would not provide an email for me to make a complaint to and would not answer whether I would receive a confirmation email that my complaint had been logged and where I could receive updates on the situation. They kept dodging the question or didn’t know the answer. I’ve never had these issues with Three in the past.

The deal was for two years with the first six months at half price. I have been charged for the first two months at full price.Shop said unable to help (don't think this is legal in UK as you should always take things up with the shop first) so rang Three. Agent finally understood the issue and asked me to email the contract through. I have heard nothing. No acknowledgement no credit nothing.As Three is in breach of the contract I will cancel if not resolved within 28 days of my complaint and transfer elsewhere.

Add to all these, I have never received a bill from three and all the payment up to now were done on direct debit.

Three,7,GB,1,Apple Watch Cellular FAIL,21-Sep-23,7cc0f33e-33f4-40e6-bd92-740af216b243,"I’ve been a three customer for over 10 years but I literally dread the day I have to actually interact with their customer services or heaven forbid, if something goes wrong!  Three customer service is beyond shocking, that’s plainly obvious.. unfortunately I encountered a problem last week when I upgraded and changed my cellular Apple Watch to a new one.  I had a smartwatch pairing data plan on my series 6 and that worked fine for a year.  When I set up my new Apple Watch ultra I expected the cellular to carry on as normal but hang on, this is three, things aren’t that easy!  When I unpaired my old watch from my phone and paired the new one it asked if I wanted to “transfer” the cellular plan, obviously yes.. having accepted this it then seemed to just get stuck on “activating” for days, no cellular data.  In my three app it also stated that my device was unpaired.  Eventually I was unable to select a cellular plan in the watch settings, it kept failing and telling me “there’s a problem”. First I tried the web chat and just as expected they were awful.. not listening to my query, responding with things like “do you need help deleting the my3 app?”, they also told me it was “impossible” for a customer service advisor to cancel an addon or cancel smartwatch pairing their end.  In the end I managed to cancel the smartwatch pairing when I called the call centre after an hour on the phone.  All because I couldn’t get the smartwatch cellular plan to work or transfer.  Nobody at three had any idea how to fix the issue and could barely understand what I was actually asking.  All I wanted was a smartwatch cellular data plan to swap to my new watch, not too much to ask is it.  I now have to hope that they cancel it, wait a month and then try to re-add or re pair the cellular when the original addon is gone.  They are also still charging me for a month I can’t use. Fingers crossed but I’m not hopeful.Edit/update - Three responded below admitting that they couldn’t resolve this problem.  They also advised me to join a webchat - Complete waste of time that I’ll never get back.  It’s a lost cause. # Apple Watch Cellular FAIL",Negative,-0.098207071

I need to change the email address (the one I use to login to my account with). So, about 2 months ago, I checked the support pages and everything it tells you to do in the Three app you can't so couldn't change it there. Next I tired the Three chat option to talk to someone at Three. After speaking to 2 different agents the first one told me they couldn't do it as my account had an issue and the second agent said I have to go to a Three store to do it. So, went to the Three store and they tell me this happens all the time and they can't do it! So, they tell me to email proofs at three mail dot com and give them my details, including proof of ID (my driving licence) and tell them to change my email from my old one to my new one. Did that months ago and I am still waiting for a reply.I really need to change my email address on my account and after 2 months of trying I'm back at square one.

Three,1,US,1,I don't have Three but they charge me anyway,14-Sep-23,03a04f3c-74ef-4fa7-abac-ab71f3cae5d6,"2nd UPDATE (29 September):  THREE Retaliated against me for these TrustPilot by referring me to a debt collection agency.   I have now opened a complaint with the Communications Ombudsman, and sent them verification from my bank showing Three collecting two seperate mobile plan charges from my bank account each month (every 2 weeks, to be precise).  The last payment Three collected from my bank was on 14th September, 2 weeks ago.  As a reminder,  my service was cancelled in 2020 and I was on a pay monthly plan.    Is it legal for Three to bill me for three years after cancellation,  and then send me to collections when I complain about it?  1st UPDATE (19 September):  THREE response to the issue I posted yesterday is a copy/ paste from a response they provided to another person, and an invitation to join the same online chat forum which hasn't resolved my issue in 3 YEARS (and where someone attempted to take my money and my personal information). This is completely unacceptable!  I want to speak with your Legal department.  They have my email address.  Please have them email today. ORIGINAL (16 September): I had a monthly contract plan with Three from 2012 until Three cancelled my service in June 2020 during the height of COVID Lockdowns, while I was in another country. I had an excellent payment history but Three claimed that I had overused their free international roaming (that included in my plan) and they informed I had 14 days to get back to the UK or they would cancel my service.  I could not travel and did not want to risk infection, so I purchased a local phone and instructed Three to cancel my monthly plan and stop pulling payments from my bank account.  The service ended on June 24, 2020.  But,  Three has continued to collect the monthly service charge from my bank, and an extra monthly charge, each month from June 2020 to now.  Chats get me nowhere.  I cannot call the 333 service line from a foreign phone.  The latest attempt to chat with a representative was yesterday.  They said they couldn't cancel unless I paid them extra money,  I refused.  Then the representative tried to get me to divulge personal information.  Three has drained all the money from my UK bank account, without providing service,  and refuses to stop collecting my money.

In December of last year my contract with 3 came to an end, I didn’t upgrade my phone and I kept it as a sim only deal for £12. All was going well until April came and I get an email saying I had an outstanding balance of £100 and it had been sent to a debt collection agency. I called 3 and asked them why I was being charged a £100. They said it was because I cancelled my contract and didn’t call them to let them know. I NEVER cancelled my contract I switched my contract to a sim only deal because it was more affordable. So you would think if someone had an outstanding balance of £100 that they WEREN’T aware of, for something as petty as not calling them to let them know you switched your contract to a sim only deal they would email or call you about it right ?.Nope…. I didn’t get a single email regarding the fact I owe £100 until April when they sent an email saying “your account has been sent for collections”. Not a single phone call either, they waited 5 months to tell me that I had an outstanding balance. Instead of emailing me they let me ￼incur charges on my account for 5 months. If they had emailed or called me I would’ve explained the situation that I have switched to a sim only deal and I hadn’t cancelled my contract with them. My Experian credit score went down from excellent to poor within the space of a week and now that’s going to stay on my report for the next SEVEN YEARS. I was planning on applying for a mortgage but how can I with a credit score like that, they’ve literally RUINED my life this past year. I tried explaining to my credit company about the misunderstanding and they contacted 3 on my behalf but 3 told them a bunch of lies so I can’t even get the late payments removed. I thought that was the end of it, however since I’ve been using a new number they have been secretly charging me each month for the old number I don’t use and they sent me an email saying I owe £50!!. The nerve of these guys…absolute criminals. I had to call them to discontinue my old number so I didn’t get charged anymore.

Smartwatch pairing does not work, cannot for the life of me get it to connect to my data plan despite hours of troubleshooting.These issues would be fine if the customer service team would deal with them but instead I am on the phone for them for hours every week, on hold, transferred to a different department, and often eventually hung up on whilst on hold.

Instead I am forced to call back again and go through the exact same troubleshooting steps each time that don't work.Due to the lack of a solution, I decided to leave Three as I know that other network's smartwatch pairing works just fine. However if you phone the cancellations department they request a large fee to cancel the contract early. If you explain to them the issues you are having, and ask for the fee to be waived due to the unresolved network and billing issues, they either struggle to understand, or will transfer you back to the relevant departments who STILL cannot solve your issues.

This happened 7 hours ago, and I still do not have data restored after 10+ attempts of turning it off and then on, and resetting data settings various times. 9) On top of this, I was charged £80+ on my data for the month, when what I was led to believe was a payment that included unlimited 'Data Roaming'(WHY was I charged £80? When was this changed? Why was I not informed?10) When writing, I've wasted 3+ hours trying to restore the data, 7+ hours waiting for it to be restored, and it still hasn't, and £80 for data that never arrived. I still cannot use my data.11) The app does not allow me to get a direct debit, even when I try to resolve this12) This happens every single month, I'm sure you have records of the conversations, it would be painful to look through them, but you will see how crazy this is.I can never report this anywhere, I asked many times for someone to explain this to, not just for my sake, but because this is a company worth £10,000,000,000+ and it literally fails to perform the most basic functions. The app is almost unusable, it directs to the website, it's bugging constantly, it's unbelievable (literally) that this email has to be sent.

They offered me free cancellation which I accepted it took them 4 weeks (where I was paying bill) to send me the return bag for the router which never arrived. all this time I was offering (twice per week min 4 hours on telephone or chat) to return the router to the shop I bought it. They rejected any of my proposals. They proposed to me to keep the router (I have the transcript) and they cancel the line for free. they cancelled the line immediately but they charged me £371.89. it took me another month on phone and chat to prove that I am not an elephant and I agreed on free cancellation. They cancelled my access to My3 and I could see if i have credit. They have never sent me a paper bill at home. At the end they charge me £57.04 which I learnt about because I went to a local THREE shop and I asked for possible credit because I don't trust THREE. I paid the amount immediately at the shop under the employees instructions (the only person that actually hold the customer service of THREE) and I had acknowledgement from their account immediately. 4 days later I had an email from a company CRS that I have a debt and a link to pay. I spoke to them, I send them proves of my payment and they acknowledged the payment and apologized for the inconvenience . I am now on the THREE chat and they are keep telling me I have debt.

My data has been running at 0.4Mbps for WEEKS despite nothing being wrong or actually interrupting signal. I fully believe they throttled me for being a data-heavy user, on a rolling contract, and a cheap contract at that, who hasn't upgraded since 2021.I asked first chat guy why my data was slow, he said there were 'tech issues' and he couldn't check. I asked if they were throttling my account, he terminated the chat.I ask the second guy outright if they were throttling me, he said to please hold while he checked for issues, then he terminated the chat.By the third chat, nobody would pick up. I was admittedly furious by this point but frankly if I used the language I wanted to I'd probably get banned by Trustpilot.Like literally, tell me you're throttling my account, without telling me you're throttling my account.Horrible, horrible little people they are.I'm not normally rude to support chat people but they were so incompetent and kept cutting off the chat so they didn't have to help me that I couldn't stay calm about it anymore! I'm switching immediately, what absolute goblins they are.Well they lost their chance. I'll have to upgrade now to a 36 month contract at £56 a month... but it'll be with EE.

I have been having problems with them since June. I am only with this provider because a family member of mine was helping me with a phone bill and chose this network provider. Both times when corresponding with customer service I was told I have roaming and everything should work as it would if I was in the UK. Not ONCE was I informed about the daily charges I would have to pay if I wanted to even use my roaming. I was given a contract under false pretences and when I asked for clarification on one part of the contract information was withheld from me on purpose. Prior to this I was told that roaming had been enabled for me whilst in Montenegro and yet it still wasn't working. Both times I wasn't informed that I have to pay a daily charge leaving me stranded in foreign countries with no way to contact home unless I'm connected to WiFi.Now when I am trying to sort out the issue they are simply trying to offer an apology and they are taking my issue as 'internal feedback'. This company is a complete joke. They purposefully do not give you information so they can hide it within the contract and when you ask for clarification they still don't explain it fully. My contract with Three is basically invalid and all they want to do is give me £20. This company is so ridiculous it's beyond me. I keep asking why I wasn't told and I keep getting the same 'it will be taken as feedback'.

Three,5,GB,1,Just had a really bad experience with…,09-Sep-23,cc9e3acb-2b99-4416-af17-27beb361e87d,"Just had a really bad experience with three who I have been a customer with for years.I signed up for a 24 month contract at £9 a month for 4GB of data, half price for the first 6 months.I added various data add-ons when I went away and went on the app to cancel them in June. I am a web developer and know my way round an app but struggle with this one every time I use it. The ability to clearly see bills and what dates and costs they cover is abysmal. I had tried to cancel add-ons on the app before and had had errors. On this occasion I thought I had cancelled the add-on of unlimited data.A few months later I realised that my bills had gone from £9 to £21!After a few attempts at finding out why and sending them my initial contract as proof I was eventually told that I had upgraded my plan on the app to unlimited data (in June) and therefore was paying £21 a month. I have no recollection of doing this, it was the day I thought I had cancelled my data add-on. I was not sent any emails to say my contract has changed and on checking I did find a text message which just told me the cost had changed I had assumed this was the cancellation of the add-on. It did not tell me that I had signed up to £21 a month for the rest of my contract.The upshot was I was not able to revert to my original contract cost of £9 a month.I just think it’s appalling that someone as computer literate as myself was able to do this without even knowing.  The app is simply not fit for purpose. And I was then locked into that price for the rest of my contract without a clear notification this is what had happened is simply not fair.Three did eventually revert these changes for me but it took an hour of being on the chat system to customer services. I would just say be very very careful using the online services. # Just had a really bad experience with…",Negative,-0.093245614

Previously wrote about three dragging the return that I requested on day 1 of my 14 day cool down period. After being sent in circles and constantly having to phone every other day to go through same rubbish, which to anyone else is simple and easy to sort out. Finally the postman turned up on my doorstep with a return label - don't listen to three's rubbish about a jiffy bag it will just be a label so have your product in a bag ready. As the postman was walking off and I felt something was missing. Luckily I remembered how the staff I spoke to about my return said make sure that I get the tracking number. It should be automatically given by the postman in a normal world but not by 3, they don't make it that way. I therefore asked, wrote down and kept the tracking number safe. I suspected three was going to say they had not received it and lo and behold that's exactly what happened. I got an email 2 days ago to say that they hadn't received my parcel. On checking the tracking, yes it was delivered and a photo of the person's feet and doorstep were in the photo. Received. End of. If you don't get the tracking number no doubt three will have their item back and still try to  charge you. Please if making a return don't give this sly company the chance to rip you off.

Last month, they were upgrading their app, which meant I couldn't check my bill statements or make payments. Despite contacting their customer care and requesting to set up a direct debit to avoid missing payments, their upgrade caused them to be unable to process my payment. Surprisingly, they still didn't stop my service or notify me about the issue. Then, out of the blue, they debited me for two months' worth of payments, totaling £47. I was willing to accept this, but today I discovered that they reported a missed payment to the credit union, resulting in a negative impact of -47 on my credit score. This is completely unfair, considering I had already set up a direct debit. When I reached out to them again today, they claimed their system was down once more.

Plenty.I have been constantly harassed by them to pay a debt I am under no obligation to pay, again since I cancelled during my trial period.Three, including Eileen, promised me multiple times they will get in charge of that too and speak to the debt collecting agency - apparently nobody ever did, at least according to the collectors.Last month I was told they could not close my case since I never returned the hub!!I showed them proof I did with previous conversation with their representative Ross confirming me that 1. the hub was finally returned and 2. I was long due for a refund, but they told me I needed to provide them courier receipts - luckily (and, if I might add, in their face) I managed to retrieve them after 6+ months and sent to the address I was provided.Which was wrong, I guess their support can't even copy&paste what is on their guidelines.Finally they pass me the right one and submit all the documentation, while at the same time I am now billed for hundreds of pounds for a service I used ruinously few weeks last year and never touched again.I sincerely hope they will be extremely ashamed of themselves - that kind of shame that forbids one from looking their loved ones in the eyes with a clear conscience.Thank you, Three!Edit: thanks for proving you don't even bother to read people cases with your latest comment here, Three. Just to reiterate:1. I cancelled on time and your salesman told me to wait for a courier to retrieve the hub that was not coming (wrong address, it turned out - not my fault);2. after the address issue was clarified, DPD came to take it and then they delivered it back TO ME the following day;3.

This extended delay has caused significant inconvenience and disruption to my daily activities, both professionally and personally. I rely heavily on seamless connectivity, and the inability to get the eSIM up and running has been a major setback.Considering my long-standing relationship with your company and the multiple contracts I hold, I had hoped for a more efficient and effective resolution. Unfortunately, the lack of progress and communication on this matter has left me extremely dissatisfied.I kindly request your urgent attention to this matter. It is my sincere hope that you can expedite the eSIM activation process and provide me with a clear timeline for when I can expect a resolution. I understand that technical issues can arise, but the lack of transparency and proactive communication has been disappointing.I value the services your company has provided me over the years, and I believe that this issue can be resolved to our mutual satisfaction.

Not sure how you can go through the process get approved and confirmation every thing was passed and approved and even told everything was passed and still nothing! All I seemed to be told was oh I can go through the application again! No 3 times, 3 credit checks all going through and nothing, not a chance was I going through the process a 4th time! The error was clearly on there side yet instead of actually resolving it at there side they just seemed to push me to try and go through the process a 4th time, What network would have this practice? What network would ask the customer to go through the process this amount of times despite them knowing it should of all been done the first time, it was clear they don't know what there doing instead of looking into the issue there only fix was to further put the customer to unnecessary credit checks again, which is alarming and can potentially damage the customers rating! After going through the whole complaint process they Credited me 30£, my contacted ended yet it says ended 6th of September, the information is conflicting I contacted them explained all this and when my contract actually ends as I want to leave the network and they was pushing off a upgrade I'm eligible for and they was aware of the past issues and reassured me it shouldn't be a issue this (this is a month later) they apologized and said it should all go through with no issues, so I decided ok maybe the system issues or whatever has been fixed so proceed on the upgrade link on my account go through the process and it declines me! I should of known, I regret even believing them a 4th time, but for it to straight up decline my application after submitting it is a insult, when I'm entitled to upgrade my account! Absolutely hands down the worst network in the UK and the upgrade process is one big mess.I'm done with Three network once and for all and will be jumping to another network as of next week they have the worst customer care you can encounter nobody seems to have a clue to actually resolve anything oh and they have been charging me a extra £5 for not having Direct debit set up despite me setting it up multiple times yet 3 simply don't set it up with your bank and have the Audacity to charge a extra £5! Can't believe how a mobile provider in 2023 can be so broken and provide the absolutely most tedious customer service of all networks! They certainly don't do there jobs correctly and they certainly don't provide any actual customer care, there just a person on the phone who answers your call and tells you as long time customer they will make sure they get the issue resolved quickly... Never happens.So in a nutshell Paying your bills on time, never missing a bill, never paying bill late, once in the whole year, going through the process of simply upgrading having passed the credit checks on all 3 occasion's and still not getting the handset is just the norm for a 3 customer! You couldn't make this mess up but it's exactly how it's been for me as a 3 customer.Also when you ring customer support you never get anything resolved from the first person who handles your call,.despite going through the correct options to be put through to that department that deals with said issue you can bet your life you have to be put through to at least 3 different departments and you can bet your life That after been passed around from person to person you do not get anything actually resolved to find your self having to go through the whole process again and again. This is why they have a 61% 1 star rating that's alarming.Absolutely diabolical.Avoid three network it's not worth it.And don't bother responding with contact this and that it's pretty evident waisting anymore time to get nothing done is a waste of my time, I'm just another customer out of the 1000's that have experienced and come to accept that it's just not possible for 3 to actually get anything sorted that's why they is 1000's of 1 star.Three just simply do not function as a Mobile network everything about them is non functioning, stress inducing and time consumingAvoid three. # After been eligible for a upgrade after…",Positive,0.010019841

Since I joined, I have barely had a 4G signal at home and as my Samsung phone does not preferentially use Wifi calling, hence I can hardly make a call without it dropping out. Speaking to Three, they advised they were performing work on masts in my area so the signal strength was affected. This has continued since with no sign of improvement or date when it might improve.  I was offered £15 compensation which I have yet to receive but more importantly, I cannot use my phone at home for the most basic of functions, making a call !Dear Salman, following your suggestion I contacted your team who, after making checks, advised that the signal I am getting at my home is not good enough and there is no date they can give for it to improve.

We've separated and at the start of the separation I called to see if we could move the contract into his name, was told yes but need to wait for the new platform. Waited, called back ""no, that options not available to this number on the new platform"". So I said ""okay, well the bill is paid for now I'll give him time to get a new SIM card and move his number then we'll cancel"" ""no worries, call us back when you're ready"".I've had him removed from my home on DV. Called today to get it cancelled, was told ""you can't do that as you don't have access to his mobile number, and he's changed the email address on the account"". They don't care that a non-account holder has changed the contact details details on my contract, they won't revert it back to my email address without a OTP. They won't do the OTP to my number, nor my email address. Not that post is an option but if it was, they've ""updated"" my address from my old address I haven't lived at for 4/5 years on at least two different phone calls, but guess what, can still only get through security on my old postcode - very secure!Someone suggested I get back in touch with my abusive ex to ask him to help me with the OTP. When I raised my concerns about this suggestion to the complaints team, they also DIDN'T see the problem with that.They've point blank refused to budge on cancelling a contract in my name, costing me money each day this contract is in place. The ""resolve"", which I don't accept, is I have to drive 30 minutes to a shop to get a replacement SIM card for that mobile number and then call them off that number. I can't get to a shop for at least a week and a half as I am taking care of a housebound family member at the moment.

Three,3,GB,1,Cost me a mortgage,30-Aug-23,10528ce8-0333-4c8c-91ba-e520eb2134f6,"****UPDATE****13 months later!!! I have just got off the phone to them today and they are still refusing to refund my money even though that they have admitted that they are at fault!In January 2023, I took out a phone contract with Three. 6 months later, in June, I noticed that I had 2 payments being taken out of my account by Three. I called them up and they told me that someone had taken a phone out in my name. Apparently, when I took out my contract, their system was updating so that is how they had leaked my data. They couldn’t tell me what details had been given out and they had no way of knowing where the phone was or where it had been delivered to. The agent told me that they would cancel the phone, refund my money, and investigate how this happened. The investigation would take 14 days. I went away for a few weeks and when I came back in august, I had late payment bills for 2 months. The agent that I had spoken to had cancelled the payment from my bank but not the phone contract. I “WAS” currently trying for a mortgage, but this had dropped my credit score by 73 points. I spoke to the agent who told me that it wasn’t their fault that someone had taken a phone out in my name. He explained that as they cannot see the persons face when they ring up and order the phone, they have to assume it is me. It’s impossible for them to be certain when someone takes out a phone that they are giving it to the correct person. They then informed me that the phone had not been reported and this was down to the system being updated. I asked if it is normal for the system to update for 6 months straight as that was what I was told was the problem back in January, but they couldn’t answer that question. However, this time they would report the phone.2 days later, I received an email from a debt collection agency. I rung Three and they told me that they would contact the debt collection agency and cancel the bill so I shouldn’t hear from them again. They apologised that the phone STILL hadn’t been reported stolen. They would do that straight away and I should hear back within 14 days. They agreed to send me a letter and email that I could pass onto the debt collection agency. We were on the phone for just under 40 minutes and the agent sent the email for the debt collection agency 3 times as it wasn’t coming through. The agent then informed me that the fraudulent account wasn’t a phone contract it was just a sim. I asked if they were sure as it was a more expensive contract than mine and mine included the handset. The agent then refused to share the information because the contract was not mine. Even though it is in my name, I am not allowed to know any details of the fraudulent account.1 week later I received an email from Three informing me that they would be increasing my monthly charge.The 14 days were up, and I hadn’t heard from the fraud department. However, I received a text message from the debt collection company again asking for the money. I called Three and after going through their security checks the agent was going to pass me onto their relevant department. But not wanting to miss an opportunity. He informed me that they were running a special promotion and asked me if anyone in my household was looking to upgrade or was on a pay as you go. He then asked me not to use profanities or he would have to disconnect the call. I thought at least one of us should be helpful, so I stopped swearing and settled for non-swear words such as scumbag and parasite. I believe that satisfied us both and felt it far more appropriate. I then reset my manners ready for the next agent. I informed the new agent that I desperately needed the message for the debt collection agency that I had been promised it 2 weeks ago. He told me that they don’t have the ability to send out information to pass onto a debt collection agency about an ongoing fraudulent investigation. I corrected him and told him that I was waiting for a letter and 3 emails from his colleague. She had sent them out 2 weeks ago. However, he confirmed that nothing had been sent from her and that she was in fact lying to me. I asked should I just pay the debt collectors as I am more concerned about the damage that is being done to my credit score, but he advised me not to. However, it was the last of the 14 days and that I should hear from the fraud department tomorrow, and that agent was also going to personally ring me.Next day received an email from the debt collection agency again. Agent did ring me but only to let me know that nothing has changed, and he is going to ring me in 7 days. I am not going to hold my breath. Joining Three was a terrible decision. I would definitely not recommend joining them. I can no longer get a mortgage because of them and rather then helping me, they have lied constantly to hide their incompetence. # Cost me a mortgage",Positive,0.04213925

I took a sim only contract that included 14 days GoRoam. I was then informed by Three that after 12 months when my contract finishes I will lose those roaming days but its ok i just pay the same and have to pay for roaming on top. The T&Cs online about this are not clear and this means i’d pay £5 extra a month to have the roaming for 12 Months then still pay that and then on top again for roaming. I immediately cancelled my contract and for now have taken pay as you go as this is a better option for roaming than contract. I spoke to the twitter team and they tell me that the roaming add on will renew every 12 months even if im out of contract. Which is it Three? Also the deal I took has now ended so either way it’s really annoyed me that everything is so unclear.

Been with them for over 12 years and the last 4 months been lied to by about 8 different people. Started with a chat agent illegally upgrading my contract.

Logged into my 3 account 2 days later to see they had without my consent. Spoke to 4 diff people who confirmed my old contract and perks had been restored and I wouldn’t be charged for roaming. Came back off holiday to see I’d been charged each day. Yet again spoke to a couple diff people who advised they would credit my account with this but guess what, wasn’t done. Last chat agent I spoke to said they were adding it but couldn’t use it for the bill in July but could in august, again not added on. Spoke to someone on the phone today who said they couldn’t refund my direct debit and use the credit. Advised I could use on next months bill but I won’t be here that long so no help to me. Said they couldn’t transfer me through to the complaints dept cause the queue was too big😂. If they treat others the way I’ve been it’s probably the biggest queue out of all their phone lines.

It also won’t cost you any extra whenin a Go Roam in Europe destination to make calls or text to standard landline or mobile numbers in other Go Roam in Europe destinations. Fair Use Policies Apply (see page 20).'To sum it up, no information about a cap within first three months, advanced plan is false advertising or a hoax and in the end I had to pay £10 to use my phone anyway.

For the rest, I spent up to 5 hours, trying, failing and succeeding with a succession of agents, via phone and live chat to get it fixed.  Live chat is agonisingly slow, with security taking upto 30 minutes: the phone system stops taking inputted numbers after the third digit selected.

Like many people, I struggled to separate myself from life online and had seen a steady increase in daily screen time. It was getting to the point I was considering more serious ways of breaking this cycle - unplugged retreats etc. Then I moved to 3. Problem solved! I get signal almost no-where, and when I do it’s unusably slow. I live and work in Central London, presumably being slowly microwaved by the density of telephone signal rippling through the air around me. I’m glad to say Three have taken the conscious decision to keep their hands clean of this doubtless future health disaster by not even trying. As a result of joining Three I’ve cut my screen time in half, been registered as a missing person twice, and successfully transitioned off-line. I also can’t thank Three enough for the data passports they text you about but kindly don’t provide automatically.

I call them every 2 weeks because my internet service is either down or slow, “refer to our website to see if there’s issues in your area” - yeah, it’s said the same thing since December 2022 but yet nothing has been fixed or sorted.All they do is offer me a few £ off my bill but that doesn’t mean much when I still have lagging or no service every week. “well it’s the weekend it will be busy in your area” … so you’re saying every weekend I am expected to just deal with no service? When no other network has this issue? It’s laughable.I’ve been with Three for probably over 10 years now and when my my mobile contract ends next month I am never renewing it with them & I will wait out for my Three broadband contract to end too. It’s a shoddy network, unhelpful customer service (granted it’s probably not their fault if the actual company won’t fix issues).They are the cheapest network by far but I would rather pay ££ more for a service that works and is reliable. # The Worst.",Negative,-0.135620915

After purchasing a three 5g home broadband box, the monthly one, where you pay extra not to enter into a contract, don't do it!!! is my advice. Besides it didn't work in our location. We decided a month was enough, 4 months on we are still getting Bill's threatening letters, emails and text's. We've spent no exaggeration hours each time on the phone to them, for them to say all is ok, then the Bill's and threats continue. It took them 3 months to send the returns package, which we didn't originally know anything about, all in the small print lol and also you are signing up for a rolling contract you can't cancel, they keep billing you, I cancelled direct debit to stop, with no way of contacting them satisfactorily. We have know had acknowledgment of returned 5g box 3 months later. You have to return in perfect condition with all items and packaging, something we weren't told, it's in small print lol, fortunately we kept everything. But still getting Bill's and threats. I'm not stressed usually, but they will add to your credit reference, late payments and defaults!!!! Reducing credit score. That battle hasn't begun yet. It's been I can quiet honestly say the worst choice I've made with broadband using Three sadly, we have 3 x phone contracts 20 years and because we've never had to make changes or cancel, we've not encounter any issues with Three before, where we would of given them 5 stars every time and recommended to all, never seeing the incompetent other side of Three, well the saga still goes on, another threatening bill today and never got through to speak to them once again. I've put 4 customer complaints in. One on phone a few months ago 1.3/4 hours on phone, have screen shot of time to prove, they asked me am I happy and is complaint resolved, which on the strength of what they were telling me I was.

Three,31,GB,1,Check with the help desk and don’t believe the THREE App,26-Aug-23,d7e8c8d8-3203-43ac-a93e-dc1eeedd2544,"I have had a THREE phone contract for many years, the last 2 years of which were for a phone and sim. However, wanting to cut costs I searched around for a sim only contract. I found one with ID mobile oddly for just a tenner a month, but daily checked the THREE app until it said there were no further amounts to pay. As soon as it said no further fees, I did a puk request and moved to ID mobile. 2 months later I got a bill from THREE for 77gbp! I phoned the help desk and asked them why they had sent me a bill when their own app stated there was nothing to pay. The help desk agent told me that there were fees to pay, but these were contractual and not cancellation fees. Despite the app saying no fees were due! What a scam. So my advice to potential THREE customers is to be very careful and if you are already a THREE customer, not to believe a thing the app tells you. Bite the bullet and phone the help desk and ignore the app because even when their own app tells you there are no more fees, it’s not necessarily indicating the truth.Just wanted to add that after getting in touch with three as requested, and spending an hour on chat with them ending up with the billing team after the customer services team said I was overcharged, the billing team said I was not. This company does not quite know what it is doing as two separate departments gave conflicting statements and all I achieved was wasting an hour on online chat on a bank holiday.

But a few days ago I ported two mobile phone numbers to Lebara and things have taken a turn for the worse!Both numbers were sim-only, PAYG, topped up, as necessary, by credit card.  Both numbers had credit balances when ported.  And Three confirmed by text that I could claim a refund once the numbers had ported.  So I ""chatted"" with Three to ""test"" the refund process.  I suspect there isn't one!First of all Three claimed my old number never existed.  Eventually it said it had found my account (which by now wasn't available to me) and that I should ""walk into a Three store to get a refund"".  When I explained I'd have to make a 60 mile round trip to the nearest store and it would take me 10 hours to ""walk"", the support agent said I'd get the refund in my bank account within three days.But Three doesn't have my bank details.  So I asked the agent to tell me the last two numbers of my bank account which it couldn't provide for ""security"" reasons.  When I said Three definitely didn't have my bank details, the agent closed the Chat.  I have a copy of the Chat as evidence!Maybe I picked the only bad apple in Three's support team but I have a nasty feeling that getting my refund is going to be a mighty big challenge.  As my wife suggested, perhaps Three deliberately makes it difficult, hoping we give up and it keeps our money.The good news is Lebara offers far more for a lot less.

Never received the phone (after waiting in on 3 seperate occasions). I called them up to cancel the contract within the cooling period. Yet they still took money out of my account. They agreed to refund this, no refund given. Still continued to charge me for the service. I wasn't even aware they were still charging me as due to personal health issues I wasn't keeping track of my finances. They then had the audacity to get a debt collection company onto me for £40 - the same contract I cancelled and never received a phone. Their customer 'service' is awful and even the thought of having to deal with them over this is exhausting.UPDATESince writing this the issue still hasn't been resolved. When I called Three I was informed the systems and had crashed and that they'd call me back, they never. I called today and spoke to a representative called Sheefa. To give her her due she was polite and as helpful as she could be. She informed me an investigation had been opened however I shouldn't hold out much hope. The downside was after this they had the audacity to try and sell me something. The guy wouldn't take no for an answer and I left the call so upset I was shaking.

They're now telling me I owe them £80 for a tablet ! I have never even taken a contract out on a tablet. I've been reading the other in here and this seems to be common. They said they'll phone me today. And the original issue still isn't resolved. Scam artists.UPDATE - They phoned me back, put me on hold, then told me I'd get a call back tomorrow. HOW IS THIS EVEN LEGAL ??!!!!! First chance I get I'm leaving this company, and you can take your bot replies Three and stick it where the sun don't shine. I'm raging with this company.UPDATE - 25/11/2023The issue was resolved today. I spoke to a Prasad on the phone and he was very articulate, calm and helpful. I'm sad I felt the need to leave this as my broadband service with Three has always been consistent and a decent speed.

I am now committed to the 2 years contract but happy with it so far. And it is a lot cheaper than my previous provider, Talk Talk. Although I had to give up my land line but I never used that anyway. I did have to contact Three shortly after receiving the hub because I had lost the WI-FI because I had been messing with the settings, so completely my fault. I contacted them through the chat-box. They responded straight away and they patiently explained to me how to get the Wi-Fi back. (I am not technically minded). I am also comforted to know I have a Three shop nearby.

Have spent 1.5 hours with online chat without resolution & 2 personal visits to local 3 shop where I got some good customer service but who could not resolve the issues straight away but managed to resolve 1 issue & gave me a phone number for the second issue.Both issues were caused by 3's so called web / app updates - supposedly offering a better experience, ha ha!The issues were caused by the fact that I have 2 Three accounts & had to re-register details to access account details via app or PC. I ended up having to sort new passwords, another alternative e-mail address as 3 can't seem to register 2 accounts with the same user e-mail address & it was a nightmare.Even the helpful 3 employee in their shop could not resolve them easily & had to go there twice. He had to admit that the processes involved were utterly ridiculous. The phone number he gave me to resolve the second re-register issue resulted in 30 mins on the phone to a very pleasant adviser who sympathised with me & said there were indeed difficulties which she would try to resolve & is to phone me back within 24 hours. She also said it may well be that I would have to see if I could open & offer a new e-mail address different from those previously used as the systems did not seem able to cope. This really is an inconvenience to say the least & I have lost several days of internet access because of 3's shabby website / apps where re=registering is compulsory.

In May 2022, i cancelled the contract. They never cancelled it - and continued to take the money from my account for over a year. My fault, as i never realised this until May 2023 when i cancelled my direct debit. I then got a letter advising that i was 2 months behind with payments. I called them to explain the situation and they agreed that they had not canclled the contract as they had been trying to contact me on the phone number for the chip that no longer existed. They apologised and said all would be sorted. They obviously kept my money even though they admitted thier error.  The following month, i received a letter from ""PastDue"" debt collecters!. I called them to update them and they said they would look into it. I have since received a further 6 letters - and made a further 3 calls. They are now using bullying tactics and my once excellent credit score has been affected by this. The debt they say is £54.00. I can afford to pay it - but on principle - i will not.

They couldn't not solve it.Finally I said ok let do only eSim with the watch.

Run two numbers with them, never had a problem for years! All that changed this year. We always had good service at home, able to receive and make calls as well as receive texts - pretty obvious right, I mean those are the basic’s aren’t they! Well that all changed when none of this worked for 12 weeks, with Three reporting ‘network problems in the area’ and ‘engineers working on it’. Contacting Customer Services is a real challenge. When I did get through, they (said) they completed checks and can confirm the engineers are having problems but that it would “definitely” be fixed within 7 days. Two weeks later and you guessed it nothing had changed and no contact from Three to explain why. My wife had missed urgent calls from the hospital and doctors because of zero service by Three. It is my view that Three leadership are totally aware of the problems with their service network which is quite clearly “not fit for purpose”. On that basis, my experience is they cannot honour the contract. Plus, they are clearly instructing their customer service representatives to mislead customers about when things will improve and try to appease you by offering 1 month free or £refund, when what is required is them to honour their part of the contract. My advice if you asked for it would be to stay well clear of Three. Incompetent at best. They also promised we would not be charged a leaving fee but then promptly send a closing statement asking for over £140. I also recommend for those who have had enough, that you write to Ofcom, the Ombudsman and, if you look on the government’s website for Companies House, the directors at Three to make your grievances heard!

I explained that I had a spending cap and after getting into an argument with the representative the case was escalated.This time I was told that the charges were incurred because I had the “wrong type” of cap on my account. When I explained that I never heard of more than one type of cap, the representative was understanding and promised the charges would be waived. Ok, great.More threatening letters, and now a black mark on my credit report. I call again, and once more I argue with a representative until it is escalated. This time the representative flat out refuses to acknowledge the previous conversations and demands that I immediately pay them.

Three,3,GB,1,Liars and shocking customer service,08-Aug-23,c319189f-ea44-4fa8-a76f-478a09685a1f,"So….the email they gave me to escalate shockingly poor customer service I am being told ‘cannot accept emails’ so here it is…,I went into the Cabot Circus store in Bristol on the 8th August this year and asked explicitly for more data and to keep my phone, which I am happy with. He did not check to see if I was in-contract (which it turns out I was 6 months out of). I was never given the option of a SIM only contract, and told that I had to have an upgrade if I wanted more data as my 'phone is old'. I challenged this, but your customer service representative repeated this line, which subsequently turned out to be a lie.My husband had, on the same day, gone into another 3 Bristol store and asked for the same thing and was promptly put onto a sim only contract for £10 a month with 60GB of data. He told me this and I went straight back to the store I had just visited (less than an hour later) and asked to cancel the upgrade that I had been duped into and be put on the SIM only option. The (different) customer service rep didn't have a clue whether this could happen or not and had to get on a live chat herself to ask! Eventually after a long wait she said that she had managed to do so, and it would take 48 hours to take effect, after which I would have to come back into the store to request my SIM only contract.I did this, went back into the store as instructed(for the third time). The (different again) person I spoke to said that according to your system an upgrade reversal hadn't been logged and that I still had the phone, which I had handed back when I went in the previous time. They said that a SIM only contract was not an option for me, unless I cancel my contract and phone number and rejoin as an entirely new customer, which is absurd. The length of time that this took, meant that my children missed a holiday club that I had paid a substantial amount of money (£60) for.I was told that I would have to go away while she looked into it and that she would call me back. When she did a few days later, she offered me a range of expensive options including a SIM only contract for £33 a month (without even a new phone!), due to the fact that I am not eligible for a normal SIM only due to having started a new 2 year contract (which was missold in the first place).In my frustration and anger I called your complaints team. They said that they would reverse the upgrade and call me back with the SIM only deal, or an equivalent, that was on offer when I first tried to sort this. When he did call back a week later he said that he hadn't managed to reverse it but would then call back again in a week with an update.I was too angry and upset and so asked my husband to help. He then took the best part of an hour out of his work (costing him at least £50) and called your customer service line. After a lengthy and confusing conversation he was assured that I had been transferred onto a one-month rolling contract and that when I was back from my holiday (which now felt utterly ruined) I should go back into the Bristol store and they would then be able to put me onto a SIM only.I have just returned from the store (fourth visit!) where I have been informed that my account is still showing as me being on the 2 year contract and transferring onto a SIM only isn't possible.I was given an email today to escalate the issue. I have just received notification that this email cannot be accepted. It’s a joke! I feel like I’ve been taken for a total ride.You run unbelievably poor customer service. Your customer service reps are either liars or so poorly trained that they don't have a clue about your products. Your call centre team is the same.

I've been with three nearly 20 years and have never experienced problems like I am having now.

I try to register my number and it just says there's already an account with these details, please call to sort it out. I call and the dude says it should be working now. So I try to register my number and it says there's already an account..... It's impossible!! It's the broadband I worry about because I can't see my ballance because I can't log in. It now also tells me I need a different email address for each account - after 20 years they tell me this! So I create another email account and try to register but no joy.

Three,6,GB,1,Are Three happy to scam their customers?,21-Aug-23,f6719194-5a19-4b53-9e3f-d0da6f584809,"Firstly a 1 star rating is generous but I can’t seemingly submit 0 stars.So after submitting a complaint to Three about a failed consumer to business transfer that has left me paying out nearly £200 for payments missed on a cancelled (but not cancelled) contract they have claimed:Three didn’t cancel my direct debit because there was no request for my consumer number to be transferred to a business line. Three claim… It was my bank that decided to block the DD payment, despite this never happening before and I certainly didn’t block / cancel it and there was definitely sufficient funds to cover this… or it was an error caused by system transfers at Three -‘but either way it’s apparently not their fault.Three claimed they have no history of the consumer to business transfer being requested - the request happened when my account was on an old system, that has since transferred to a new system. Three cannot confirm or deny if the history relating to the call may have been lost during the system transfer.My Three app doesn’t work and I can’t view my bills online. Three claim there is no history of my number or my step sons number calling Three to instruct Three to transfer my consumer number to the business account and cancel the consumer line. The call was made on either mine or my step sons phone. He works in a Three store and dealt with request whilst my wife and I sat in the just a few feet away. Three denied this took place and claimed that the call never happened. My stepson uses his own phone to call the 2 of the same numbers needed to sort out contract changes etc when supporting some of his Three customers. He asked the Three service agent over the phone to check his call history for a 3 month period to check when he’d called one of 2 Three numbers. He knows he’s used his phone to call the 2 numbers multiple times during this time frame. The agent on the phone claimed there was no history of these numbers being called by my stepson on his phone. Why is this? Either the agent is lying or the 3 Three system is broken and not recording customer usage accurately. We are paying for 2 business lines and consumer line - the consumer line was supposed to have been cancelled 3+ months ago but Three as requested.My mistake? Mixing up my SIM cards and accidentally continuing with the consumer line that was supposed to have been cut off. And taking the advice from the Three store to ignore the sms messages about failed payments as they said this would be an automated message sent in error.

Three,13,GB,1,"don't even bother using Three, terrible service",21-Aug-23,aa37e477-3ff5-4bee-a3b9-92a0bfd2ef23,"in June I was between moving houses and thought that I should get a temporary wifi router for the time being, the router was promised to have an average of 25mbps which isn't bad as it was temporary, however, the actual average wifi speed was a measly 2mbps which as not enough for a home full of people. due to this, I called up the Three customer service team to return the broadband and cancel my account as I was not happy with its performance. however actually returning the router was a massive hassle, nobody picks up the phone at all, and when they do you are redirected to multiple different people who also redirect you to others, one of the call handlers told me to call my local branch to sort out the return and cancelation however when i called them up my branch told me that it was not possible due the branch not having the authority to do so and according to them the customer service team have told other people to call their local branch, only to have to call the customer service team again. after a few days of trying i was finally able to get a return ready, all i had to do was wait for a free return package to put the router in. However that package never came, in fact, i waited for a month before i decided to call the customer service group to see what the problem was, just asking about my return and cancelation took a long time as nobody wanted to deal with my call or they didn't understand what i was asking them, turns out that they believed that i have already received my returns package and that there were going to charge me for not returning the router in the time given, in order to sort the problem out Three sent me another returns package, after waiting for more than a week i got a message saying i will be charged as i still have not returned the package, at that point i still have not received the returns package so i couldn't return it anyway. 10 days later i finally received the package and posted it the following day, i was given a royal mail tracking receipt that i kept safe as proof that i have posted the router back to Three. a week later i see that Three is going to charge me again even though i have canceled my account and returned my router, i called up customer service to see why i am facing another charge, the person on the phone asked for the tracking number that i received when i posted my router and said that my account has now been canceled and that he can confirm that i have returned the router.i didn't receive any emails from three again and thought i was finally free, up until today when i saw a £24.00 charge in my account. i had just moved houses so all my papers are jumbled up and out of reach.i called customer service one more time to figure out why i have been charged even though i don't own a three-device or account anymore. turns out that three don't know that i canceled my account and returned my router since they didn't receive it, the money they took is for the monthly contract i supposedly have as they thought the router was still in use, i told the person on the phone that i shouldn't even have a Three account nevermind a running contract since i returned my wifi router. the person on the phone said that she will check my tracking number. since it had been more than a month now that I received no news from Three so i believe that the tracking number was not needed anymore and i may have disposed of it. this meant i was unable to provide a tracking number. i even asked the call handler to give a return address so i can still look around in case i had it laying around since i had a few royal mail receipts laying around however she would not give it to me. in the end, i asked her that all the information should be in the call recording of when i last called up Three customer support since they keep recordings of every call made to them and I had read out the tracking number to the previous person who confirmed my account was deletedi am still waiting to see if a call gets returned to me as this situation still has not been resolved # don't even bother using Three, terrible service",Positive,0.009552846

I was with Three for approximately 10 years altogether, part of that was via another person so I will only relay the experience I have personally had with them. I stayed with Three for ""ease"" as my husband didn't feel comfortable switching numbers and companies. But this year we finally made the switch. In previous years they have been difficult to deal with, their chat is awkward and long-winded, that's if you can even get through in the first place. But this year takes the biscuit. I had two accounts exactly the same with them, same contract & phone. As soon as the upgrade date came around I checked to see their offers. Their ""deals"" were simply laughable. An S20 FE for over £40 per month?! I already had the S20 for two years!! That was their ""best"" deal for me. So I set about the switch for both numbers. Should be easy, their help section makes out that it couldn't be simpler! Get PAC code, give it to new service provider, receive final bill, simple!Well, after using the PAC codes, nothing came through, until they started calling my husbands number incessantly, demanding the final payment (I had this set aside ready for the final bills to come through, so it wasnt a problem, but they hadn't even sent us a bill at that stage). So I got in touch, paid both final bills, the agent CONFIRMED both accounts were closed and there would be no more bills or payments due. What a relief. Until... this morning I have received a letter stating I now owe them MORE money!!! It doesn't even explain what these mystery charges are for?! I have tried and tried this morning to get through to them, cut off multiple times, then finally connected via chat, the agent said ""Hi, how can I help"" and before I had even written ""Hi"" I was informed the agent had closed the chat!!!!

I was a Three customer for about a decade, then I left because their signal in the Highlands is not as good as other providers. I decided to return to Three after moving again, and because they offered fairly priced e-sim deals. Here's what went down. They advertised a deal online and I tried to sign up 4 times, but each time the transaction didn't go through. Crazy - a company making it impossible for you to become their customer. Still, they emailed me the paperwork each time and told me in the email I could go into their store to finish the sign up. When I got to their store, they told me they could not finish the sign up as I'd signed up online, even though their email specifically told me to go to store. I tried a different store in case the staff was misinformed and was told the same thing. So I phoned them up. After spending an eternity online trying to connect to a human, we basically went through the same thing, before they finally agreed to sign me up. Reader, it to FORTY FIVE MINUTES to complete. Insane. Now I wanted an e-sim but to get one, they had to send me a sim and then I had to phone up to get them to issue me e-sim. All while they promote the e-sim online as being better for the environment because it requires no physical sim!! So I tried to phone them up. Loads of options in the customer service line, but nothing at all about getting an esim. If you stay on the line or can't find a relevant option, they just hang up on you. I had to pretend my phone was broken to connect to a human who, very kindly, issued my e-sim. The folks on the phones are great - really great, despite what some share.

Three,1,GB,1,PAYG SIM for visitors to UK,19-Aug-23,f0e89a66-7e09-412b-9865-4bea75b33e10,"I am visiting the UK from Australia for three months and needed a UK SIM for calls, SMS, and data. There is a sign outside the Three shop in Ayr about using a PAYG SIM when visiting the UK and the cost of 100GB SIM was reasonable so I purchased it. Data reception from the house I’m staying at was very poor and voice reception wasn’t much better, Ayr is a big town so didn’t expect to have to sit very still near the window in one room to get reception but that’s what happened. The real problems happened when I tried to renew the SIM at the end of the first period. I couldn’t set up auto-renew and take advantage of the additional data allowance they kept texting me about because their website wouldn’t allow an overseas billing address and guess what, my CC billing address is in Australia! So, after discussing with people in-store, I bought a new data pack, they offered to add it onto my phone for me so the indication was that it wasn’t a problem to do that and I did it myself a day later, this is all in advance of the first data pack running out. All good so far, I now had £20 credit to pay the next month with. The day of expiry I tried to add the new £20 credit so that I wouldn’t have issues the next day but the Three website and the options on 444 were so confusing I actually went back into the store to get help. I was told that the option to extend my SIM wouldn’t be available until the first pack expired and assured there would be no issues. The first pack expired at midnight on 19 August and I was already in bed asleep when it rolled over, without any warning, data started using my £20 credit (Australian email etc arriving in the middle of the night no doubt), and by the time I woke up and tried to extend my SIM, my £20 credit had been reduced to less than £7! Another visit to the store and I was told “that’s the way it’s supposed to work and there is nothing we can do”, this from the same person I’d talked to at length the day before who said there would be no issues, ""its not my fault"" was the other comment. End of story is I went to a different vendor and purchased a new SIM, I now have great data reception from everywhere, wish I’d gone to O2 earlier. I wasted my £20 on Three and am less than impressed by both their in-store people and their network. Stay away folks, they may be slightly cheaper but in the end it cost me more. Oh and BTW, O2 roll unused data over from month to month, and have free minutes to many overseas countries, doesn’t happen on Three!Update after ""response"" from Three: All I can say is that I guess Three are not very serious about customer service and nothing would entice me to go back to them.

Three,35,GB,1,Avoid this company....they send debt collectors to you for money you don't owe,18-Aug-23,f3cb7743-0ff2-4b19-bf78-92a81fc20181,"I recently had a rather frustrating experience with Three Mobile that I feel compelled to share. It all started when I paid an early termination fee of £468.61 on June 5th.However, my ordeal was far from over. On July 29th, I received a letter from Three demanding an additional payment of £498.05.Perplexed by this unexpected demand, I decided to talk to Three's customer service using the online chatThe representative I spoke with explained that the additional charge was due to my alleged failure to pay the full early termination fee, which they stated was £872.21 in total.Armed with proof, I presented the transcript of my earlier payment, complete with the name of the representative, the date, and the timestamp.Uponing the evidence, the representative confirmed that I had indeed paid the entire fee and that there was no further outstanding amount.My frustration reached its peak when, on August 15th, I received an email from CRS (Collection Resource Solutions) demanding payment on behalf of Three Mobile. Enraged by the situation, I contacted Three once more, determined to clear my name.I provided the representative with the same evidence I had previously shown, and was once again assured that I had no remaining balance.To my relief, a few days later I was informed by CRS that the account had been closed and referred back to Three. Despite this apparent resolution, my skepticism lingered.So, I decided to check my account online, only to be met with a new demand from Three, this time for £29.44, supposedly the final bill for my mobile number.I found myself wondering, how could this cycle of confusion and contradictory statements continue?This time, Three claimed that the outstanding amount was merely £29.44. It was difficult not to feel like a pawn in a frustrating game.The threat of debt collection loomed once more as Three insisted on this relatively minor amount.Fed up with the situation, I reported my grievances to Ofcom, believing that such a seemingly arbitrary and inconsistent approach to billing needed investigating.The collogue I spoke to openly admitted that the extra early termination fee was their mistakeIn the midst of this ordeal, I was finally connected with a manager at Three who attempted to address the issue.At that point, I contemplated giving in and paying the £29.44 just to end the ordeal.But then, I decided that enough was enough. I reminded the manager of the previous conversations with Three representatives who had explicitly stated that I owed nothing.I questioned why, if I truly owed £29.44, the amount had not been communicated clearly from the start.I brought up the CRS link that had indicated a balance of £0.00 and armed with evidence and determination, I offered to provide the manager with the transcripts and the CRS linkMy question to the manager was that if it was a actual debt, why did the other two colleagues I spoke to say I owed nothing, and also why didn't the debt details on the CRS website says £29.44 instead of £0.00A short while later, I received a response from the manager stating that they had ""applied credit"" for the amount of £29.44, thereby clearing the supposed debt.While I'm relieved that the issue seems to be resolved, I can't help but reflect on the rollercoaster of confusion and frustration I endured over a relatively minor amount.This entire experience has left me with a sour taste in my mouth regarding Three's billing practices and customer service.It's disheartening to think that a company would resort to such tactics to extract payments from their customers, including threats of debt collection.As a consumer, it's essential to keep transcripts off all conversations with Three and to stand up for what's right and not let such practices go unchallenged. # Avoid this company....they send debt collectors to you for money you don't owe",Positive,0.017053999

These lies have been going on for almost a whole month. Everytime I contact customer support I am greeted and told the same lies over and over again, that it'll be completed soon. One of the more weird lies I have been told is the fact that my old provider has not given them the required files, which I confirmed isn't true when contacting the old provider, in addition to the provider the number is actually from.

I phoned to find out what was going on only to be told that ""the renewal did not go through"" and would not be honoured and I would have to go through the whole process again but this time with additional hoops to jump through, including a credit check which would involve me having to travel for over an hour to my bank to find out the date (over 20 years ago) that I opened my account, in order for Three to be able to do their credit check for my £10 a month SIM only contract, which I have had for over a year. As someone who is self employed and also an unpaid carer for my husband who has heart failure, there was no way I could do that. So, basically Three are not interested in doing anything to renew my contract after myself and my husband have been with them for at least 10 years with no problems paying whatsoever.

I've been a customer for 12 years, thats right, I am literally their exemplar customer, loyal, pay on time, upgrade my handset every couple of years and generally give them no problems whatsoever.Unfortunately, I needed their help recently.  Let me say, do not ever put yourself in a position where you need to ask Three to help you with something.  Why? you ask, well because first of all you'll have their chat bots to fight off.  There was more intelligence in the 8bit version of Legend of Zelda...now there's an idea..I thought this form of artificial interaction was supposed to be intelligent, no, they are mere drones that form the first line of disposable defence at the Three lair.  You will need to use sheer tenacity and an expert control over the various role play style automatic response options.  Actually this is more Monkey Island...do I need the sword, the musket or a magic potion...?Eventually you might make to the next level, after throwing a load of key words at the bots it like 'speak with agent', or 'real person', or 'bananas', or 'flibble' - I eventually got directed to the next line of defence.Level 2 is where they deploy a real person.  These are slightly more intelligent, more reactive and a bit more of a challenge, you might lose a few more lives getting through this bit, but stay with it.  These 'real people' still don't appear to have an expert grasp of the English language, thats their weapon and they deploy it in way which is designed to wear you down and make you give up before being able to complete the level. They will also try to send you back to Level 1 where you will face the low intelligence bots again, so be very careful here.Great, so we set off on a combination of me explaining that Three has forced me to re-register without having a valid email address on my account (great due diligence by the way Three!).  I eventually understand the sentences coming back from Vishwakarma and work out that they've sent me a one-time only password to reset my account...to the email address they don't have...ok. So now they tell me 'start the new chat' - brilliant, back to Level 1 - damn it, I failed! I don't even know what the Level 2 boss looks like! Can I be bothered to start again?....no.  I'm still yet to be able to re-register, I can't get through to a real person that speaks the local lingo and I haven't eaten or seen daylight for at least 3 hours, I'll start looking pasty white with dark bags under my eyes if I carry on trying to master this game. Three is happily sitting there with my old residential address on file, no email address and goodness knows what else.  I bet they'll still sell me a new iPhone though!

We are on a visit to Isle of Man; on arrival, we could not make phone calls or send texts. I have spent at least 4 hours on Chat, going round in circles, and now after 6 days, it is escalated enough to get someone to talk to, but issues still are not fully resolved. Off shore call centres just do not work, sorry to say, but they are probably cheap for Three. Today, they finally got phone calls to work and Internet, but still non SMS. Summary of events / things I have been asked to do:1) instructions to increase spend cap on Internet did not align, meaning 1st chat, which crashed after an hour. Three agreed yesterday, so this might get fixed sometime2) trip to Three shop to set spend cap, seemed to go OK, but subsequently told it hadn't been set3)  Found out that not only is there a spend cap, but also a credit limit, which may be set after 1st 3 months of contract. Are people not supposed to travel for their 1st 3 months !!!4) was asked to set network to Manual, not automatic. Not sure what this should achieve5) was asked to put flight mode on repeatedly, guess it might initialise comms, who knows6) was told to restart phone, it took me to tell Chat that surely we could lose Chat, he thought nor, but said he would call me back if I did. Someone called, but apparently could not hear me. I has asked him to send transcript of call, in fact demanded it, which he agreed to, but failed to do7) in voice calls, generally talked to as if I was an idiot,  ie wanting me to put a code in (##21#) in the middle of a call, when if I sent it, I would have cut him off; and also questioning why I needed SMS, even though its in my contractI should add on my trip, 2 other members of our party have no problem with their mobile phone services with other providers, but both myself and my partner have the same issues, with our Three phones. One Chat person even suggested it was Manx Telecoms problem. I want out of my Three contract as soon as possible, they are totally incompetent,  I've never had issues like this with other providers. Only issue is phone is via 3rd party provider, so will need to take this up with them on my return home** update and my response to Three comment below. Salman clearly did not read the comments I made in detail. Why would want to waste more of my time on Chat ?   Three have failed to solve not only my problem but my partner's too, she has had exactly the same poor experience as me. I should add also, an agent from Three even managed to set her spend cap to £9,999,  how irresponsible is that ?  In both cases, the issue is supposed to have been escalated to a higher support team, there is no evidence that this has happened.  Finally, one of our party is with ID, which I've just learnt is Three also, he has no problem.  I have no trust in Three's capability at all, after nearly 2 weeks.

AFTER I JUST TOLD THEM MY PROBLEM and i made it clear i have no wifi or any way of going online im just a disabled bedbound person and i just want my credit that i payed for. then she starts making up prices to calculate for 55 pounds going missing in less that 2 hours. then i ask how can i pay 35 for a whole month of unlimited internet and calls and text and 55 pounds for an hour and a bit of internet use. literally started making up higher prices as i am looking at my text from three about 5p per MB of datathey will literally lie to your face like its no ones business and when you call them out on it they will gaslight you.dont believe anything they say. if they reply to this they are lying dont fall for their bs. they literally owe me thousands. i am disabled and they know i can be taken advantage of and they do. if i was able i would shut down 3 HQ and save everyone's lives.i pay them for so many things they dont even provide. i can go on about a billion things they did to me but this is long enough. go for it. you will DEFINITELY regret it i GUARANTEEEEEEEEEE ITall these 5 stars are OBVIOUSLY by paid 3 agents. there is NO WAY ANYONE ON EARTH will give them anything over 1 star.i AWAYS have less signal than EVERYONE and only very specific places which are rare do i ever get full bars (which, trust me, doesnt give you good internet.) # THE MOST RUDE LYING THIEVING SCAMMING…",Positive,0.121523996

Said they apparently text us to let us know a direct debit was unsuccessful and that it was cancelled, so moving forward we’d have to pay by transfer and that there is a fee for this. This communication was never received so we had no idea a direct debit was stopped. When the direct debit failed originally we transferred the money a couple of days later, we didn’t know that the next months it would be cancelled and not automatically come out like usual and that there would be a fee for this. Bearing in mind our broadband was working fine we didn’t know too so we were none the wiser. We don’t have a three sim in our phone, it’s a sim in the broadband. We asked the advisor if she knew the this and she said she obviously did with attitude. We then asked her to say the number she has and she said the three number for the sim in the broadband. which OBVIOUSLY we can’t see as it isn’t in a phone, so she lied saying she knew the number on the system, and lied that we were texted about the cancellation of direct debits and the fee for this! We could not have seen that text!  No remorse, no apology, no help, no politeness. No offer to cancel the fees for not making us aware of them. shocking.

I then went and called three as I had a message letting me know my contract was up for upgrade, I decided on the phone to go to sim only and cancel my main contract of around £40 a month, the sim only was around £12 a month. Instead of doing an upgrade to a new phone, I did the sim only as I was (and still am) struggling for money in the current climate. All of this encounter was done over the phone, quite obviously to a call centre as it was extremely loud. I realised that nothing had come through to confirm this so I recently got in contact with three to make sure this change had occurred. They said they had no record of anything being sorted and they could not compensate me for the 7 months they have been overcharging me. I have messaged them multiple times asking for help and they have not been very useful in getting me what I was in need of, the compensation.

My surprise came when I realized that they canceled my current contract, with roaming included, before the 28th of July and they started the new monthly plan at the beginning of July, They canceled the contract but not the direct debit of the current contract, therefore I had to pay the same amount for a contract with worse conditions for the month of July.All these happened while I was abroad and because they canceled my terms of roaming, I had to buy a local Sim Card to have my mobile operative.

I did my renewal and then after I asked them why I am not able to see my previous bills on Three application and Three website. That day no able to help. Called again and asked same thing. They do not have answer. They raised complaint for this. Three company’s app giving me error like “SOMETHING’S GONE FUNNY- GIVE US A MINUTE AND TRY AGAIN. MAYBE TRY RESTARTING YOUR PHONE”. As soon as I see this error tried to change my wifi to mobile network. Used my brother’s internet data but no luck. Then I tried to change my device and still getting same error.  After that I have requested for bills via email. They sent me bills which was wrongly charged. They took direct debit payment from my account for wrong amount. Then it was not sorted yet and on 18th July 2023 they issued my new bill as per my billing cycle. Even that bill I cannot open myself. For this I have to call Three team again. And every time I have to explain them again and again. On serious note they have wasted my 45 to 1 hour time before pass my call to complaint team. Then complaint team did same thing have to explain again to each person. Staff raised my complaint with reference number 33591769. That time one of their staff advised me I have not made enough payment previously due to credit they have given me for other complaint in the past. Now for previous complaint was regarding their colleague didn’t serve me in the store and let me feel like racism. This thing hurt me again when colleague told me this. Then he offered me 70GBP goodwill gesture. That time I have advised them to leave complaint open. I believe they lack of notes by their colleague. I did my best every time and explained everything to them. They advised me to wait 72 hours. I wait for it and did not received anything. So I gave them a callback and explained again everything as their staff asked me. Then again staff want me to wait 48 hours. But strange was I received bill after calling them within 2 hours.  That time I am having same error “SOMETHING’S GONE FUNNY- GIVE US A MINUTE AND TRY AGAIN. MAYBE TRY RESTARTING YOUR PHONE” on applications. Then I tried again to contact them again and so they connected me to technical team. Tech team advised me to re-install application and want me to check online while they were on call. I did and advised error which was same as above. Then that guy advised me he will call me back within a week time. Someone give me a call on 2 days after it and advised me to do same thing again like re-install app, remove cookies and history from web browser and check my Three stuff but that error was same. Till next two week no came back to me. I tried to contact them via they Live chat but their live chat during conversation kicks me out 3 times. Then on 4th time happened same but they call me. Advised that colleague I can see different my mobile phone plan details than which I agreed on renewal time. Talked to that guy and explained same from beginning. He advised me to wait for an update I agreed with him but checked my email he raised an complaint closed it without agreed resolution which was callback. After few days mean on 12th August 2023 I received a sms and an email about they have closed my complaint reference number 33591769 and mentioned that we haven’t heard from you. But actually after that for the same issue I had many conversation with them. One 12/08/2023 I tried to contact them via call but call did not get connected. So tried via chat.

The new app is completely not fit for purpose. I couldn't find a way to actually speak to someone - only text live chat which didn't answer my questions. No way to check or change spend cap, add-ons don't show on a dashboard properly, unbilled amounts don't include purchased add-ons, rogue texts saying I've spent up to my £50 cap (which I'd previously set at £20 so presume it changed automatically with the down grade to the new app), but cost since last bill is showing as 2p - chat person said text was an error. The app basically stonewalls any attempt to raise a live query about the operation of the app meaning the only recourse is a complaint form, with up to a 7 day reply committment - utterly useless if you're on holiday and you're trying to ensure you don't get stung because you can't see what allowances you've bought or their remaining balance (calls, text, data). Putting this here in case three actually read these and either call me (the guy in the live chat said they're not permitted to call customers) or do something quick to make their customer interface fit for purpose. The live chat is also hit and miss as to whether you get someone - and my last interaction just stopped (not by me) - guessing their staff have had enough of dealing with beleaguered customers, knowing they're powerless to properly answer questions. I'll happily remove this and give 5 stars if they revert to previous form.Update 29Aug23 - credit where it's due, I received a call from three, and although the line was poor, the gist was (I think) that they'd refund the roaming data passes and take the feedback on the app.  I received a bill notification by text - the headline in the app says £45.51 to pay, but the bill (which won't open as a pdf in the android app) is the normal amount of £25.46 with no mention of the data passes or credits.  I guess I'll have to wait to see what actually comes out of my bank account.  I tried logging in on computer to download and view the bill as the android app wouldn't let me (I have pdf viewer but it wasn't listed as an option to open), but the computer asked me to register the account (again), albeit it recognised the password from when I last logged in.  Then I was asked to click pictures to verify I'm not a robot - this didn't log me in - I gave up and emailed the bill from my phone.

Essentially I've been with Three before I started to have a family of my own. Never had a problem. Network is good, when I go on holiday there's no problem. Until... I tried to upgrade to a new contract with a handset this  time. I started calling them on Monday to ask what deals they have, Hamza told me about this deal that is too good to say no. He mentioned also that the deal only came out that day so I am lucky. However this raised alarm bells for me as I travel a lot for work and I was currently away. I need a phone when I get home (end of the week) to prep it for my trip again next week. If it's a deal that just came out, and I am calling at 6pm then surely I am one of the last ones and there mite be a delay? Hamza was confident I was going to get a text the following day Tuesday, latest Wednesday of when my handset will arrive, however if I don't sign the agreement he sent to my email then there might be a delay. So signed straightaway after getting off the phone. I was so excited that I started looking for a phone for my wife as present for our anniversary coming up. (she's with o2) out of curiousity I checked the same deal that I signed up to and I found out that Hamza overcharged me £2.50 a month. No problem that's my mistake. Moving on to Tuesday -- I heard nothing, Wednesday  mid-day I started to feel anxious as I heard nothing from them yet. I called CS and said wait until 6pm and I will get a text. I called at 6pm to ask and I spoke to Raj, he said some BS for me to wait until Thursday. I called again mid-day Thursday to cancel this time as I received a text from them saying my delivery is delayed until 21/08/23. Also at this point my wife already ordered her phone the night before from O2 and she's telling me all the good deals I can get if I make the switch. I couldn't finish the phone call as I had to go back to work so I ended the call and tried again on my way home home. This is when I spoke to Naveen, I told Naveen that I want to cancel the upgrade and my current contract. I gave Naveen my details to then he realised that I have been with them since 2010. He asked why I wanted to cancel, I told him my nightmare. He then told me that he can see on the system that the delivery date is saying 11/8/23 so I should get the phone tomorrow. I told him that I am not falling for that trick again. To then he said to me convicingly that the text I got is wrong and my phone will come 11/08/23. I gave him a chance and waited until today. I got a call from their dispatch team as promised from yesterday only to tell me that we are still in the same boat and DPD who are taking the orders haven't even acknowledged the order! I spent the whole Friday morning trying to speak to someone to make sure that I cancelled everything with them and I don't get any extra charge. Based on my experience with them this week I wouldn't be surprised if they are longing out the exit process so I get pass the 14 day free cancellation period and pay extra again just to leave them! I do not normally write. But after being with them for so long I feel like the least I can do is write them a feedback. Other network provider offered me the exact same deal for the exact same phone for £5 less a month. I'm glad this happened. Now I get to see how terrible this network provider is and move to a better one.

Absolutely appalling service; how this company hasn't been shut down by regulators is beyond impressive. I've been with 3 Mobile for years and the only reason why I haven't left was the pain of moving numbers between ISPs. Thanks God that's now been sorted.For years I've been unable to text European numbers because 3 mobile doesn't have a contract with major ISPs in Europe so the routing doesn't work (that's what they told me) which is a basic functionality of a mobile network. Beyond useless Support that asks the same question 3-6 times, tries to authenticate you several times while chatting to them as a logged in user and never escalates; instead just repeats the useless ""restart your phone"" nonsense after just wasting an hour of your time.They're unable to apply some basic spam filtering, won't allow you to block known paid calling codes and are get lost in space and time when asked for logs. (I doubt they even keep those tbh)Design and UX are science fiction to 3 mobile, their iOS app is just a webapp that calls a website in the background, it's not a native app so refreshes every time you move around in the interface and loses all progress. Recently they updated their app so they're asking their customers to register an account again! Last time I witnessed incompetence at this level was with web hosting companies in the early 2000s. They removed the ability to view bills and masked the cost breakdown in such a way that is easier to just accept it rather than audit your spend.I wanted to purchase their home mobile hotspot device so tested it with my phone for a month. The connection drops randomly throughout the day, enormous latency which often makes it unpleasant to even watch 360p videos and the Chinese Great Wall blocks every other website you want to visit which makes their mobile internet pretty useless without a VPN. Running a VPN however slows everything down to a halt as even natively in a well covered 4G network I can't get more than 9mbit upload and 3mbit download. Welcome to the 90s and Edge speeds.Absolutely shameful service, they only exist because they get more new customers than they lose existing ones.

A mistake on my part to assume any part of the Three experience would be good.The shop was empty. Which is positive, I'd like to think folks would avoid them if possible, but did mean a member staff was quick to engage. I briefly described the problem, phone worked, phone no work, phone in box, please help.We quickly established that I had not taken out an insurance policy with Three to protect against crap technology and would therefore receive no further help from Three on the matter and I should call Samsung.I was asked if I wanted their number and we again discussed that the phone was bricked and therefore would not be of use. The staff member offered to call Samsung, did so on the staff handset and directed me to a chair/table much like ones found in my nursery school decades ago.I spoke with a rep from Samsung, who was very helpful and let me know my options, one of which was to trot 100 metres down the street to the EE store, EE being a repair partner of Samsung.With incredibly helpful staff at EE I was able to have the phone repaired and back in my pocket within two hours. Great job Samsung and EE.Three however are not worthy of the 1 star I have given, but zero is not an option it seems.Three seconds is as long as you need to waste considering getting your next mobile from Three.

And tried to pass me through to the business support in India. I refuse to talk to anyone from that call centre they don't understand you and are totally useless. Why is there no details or a direct email to speak to someone from England who can actually deal with this BUSINESS support complaint. Better still i will just go to the ombudsman and let them deal with it. Funny thing is you make it impossible to raise a complaint or actually help your customers but your quick enough to cry if we cancel the direct debit and refuse to pay the bill that we have been incorrectly invoiced for but impossible to resolve.You guys are a joke it's actually laughable how bad your customer services are # Not Even Worth 1 Star for Business,Negative,-0.134615385

It looks like a scam and like someone is trying to phishing your data! I deleted the app on my phone and am using my computer.

I took out 4 numbers for all the family, all a contract in its own right. The signal has not always been the best, even at home we cant receive texts most of the time, and can only make and receive calls using the wi-fi most of the time, but this is not my main issue. My main issue is that I have not really ever had to contact three until its around contract renewal time to arrange new phones and contracts and each time its a laborious chore to simply get the simplest of contract renewals. This time my son wanted a new phone, and the contract setting up in his own name, I upgraded the phone on the basis this could be achieved, and that switch over would be straight forward - here we are three months later and I have now been informed today that this is now not possible. Furthermore their recent system updates have meant that I now have to re-register new email addresses for each of the numbers I use, a separate email address for each number, plus I cannot re-register the accounts that I had before so I can see them all on one login, it simply wont let me do it. Needless to say that I have had enough after sticking by them for probably almost 13 years I have finally had enough and switching the numbers to a different service provider as they come out of contract. Some of the customer service has been extremely helpful, attentive and proactive - others have simply said sorry that's what we do!

I called into our local Three shop in Darlington to ask when it would be sorted, to which they replied…..’Hopefully this year, but we don’t know’ - So, in summary, we can’t use our ‘Business’ mobile phones where we work, but Three are more than happy to keep charging us for a service they can’t provide.

They keep sending me offers for the latest Samsung Flip and I have to laugh. I wouldnt take out another contract with these clowns if they gave it me for free. The network is broken. You have been warned. You would be better off with a couple of plastic cups connected with a bit of string. Steer clear or suffer what's like pretty much constantly using 1980s dial up pretty much everywhere around the country. Your phone will constantly report that the signal is 4g, 4g+ or even 5g but there is simply no speed even though you have plenty of signal bars. This must surely mean that the network is over subscribed and cannot cope with the demand. This happens is major cities even where you would now expect solid 5g speeds. It's often so bad that you can't even open pics on the likes of Facebook or view comments on your posts. If you contact them about it and actually manage to get through someone will just talk you through changing a few settings on your phone that makes absolutely no difference and merely wastes more of your time.

However, I digress. Firstly, why is there no option to give 0 stars? I would much prefer to give minus a million! I have been with Three for 20 years! You must be wondering how I’ve lasted this long!? To be honest, I can’t answer that. Laziness, maybe? Now though, I am at the end of my tether. There are far too many issues to list on here, if I did it would be like ‘War & Peace’ but without the Peace!! The most recent incident was my son getting his phone stolen whilst on holiday. On his return, he rang to order a replacement SIM. They wouldn’t give him one as they said he wasn’t the account holder, I was. WTA?? He’s nearly 30 years of age, with a good job & doesn’t need mummy to have a mobile phone contract. Who authorised him to have a mobile phone contract in my name? I certainly didn’t. So, I had to go into the store myself to get a replacement SIM. Did I get one? Don’t be daft, that would be far too easy & Three would hate to make our lives easy. So, all my (long) life I have been called Michelle. However, my birth certificate, driving license & passport all say Lynne Michelle. My parents simply thought it sounded better that way round, although never had any intention of calling me Lynne. So, on production of driving licence, which says Lynne Michelle, I was told I couldn’t prove who I was, so no SIM. I produced several bank cards showing Michelle & Lynne Michelle to be told they don’t accept that as ID. Within an hour or two, my arms have erupted with a stress rash. Confirmed by GP, as it’s happened before. My son cannot access anything on line as they all need to send a pass code to his number, which he doesn’t have. The saga goes on, but, Three…? don’t reply with the typical “Poor you!” response that you have to everyone else & ask me to go to live chat. You have taken days & hours of my life that I will never get back! I have already got my PAC code & as soon as I’ve found another provider, I will be hot footing away, as fast as my old legs can carry me. If ever we do get a replacement SIM, my son will be doing the same, despite still being within his contract, although he clearly doesn’t have a contract with them, as they won’t talk to him, so how will that work? I must say though, they’re happy to upgrade his phone every 2 years. I’ve never authorised this! You couldn’t make it up, could you? Now that I know I’m not alone, I challenge Three to take me on in court, as that’s where I’m heading if the whatsit hits the fan. My son has a contract, but he doesn’t, it’s on my account, which wasn’t authorised by me! How will they explain that one? I also will be claiming compensation for the stress & anxiety that this has caused.

One gets shovelled to a call centre somewhere in India,manned by staff that it’s extremely difficult to understand requiring constant repeats.Our problem stems from over 6 months ago when my partner was sent an unsolicited 3 Sim Card,together with an attempt to set up a direct debit for an account.After much wasted time trying to get hold of 3 and then explaining the situation over and over again,she was told to return the SIM card and that the fictitious account would be closed-no problem they assured her.Today my partner receives a letter effectively demanding a payment of £101 with a threat of debt collectors being called in if it’s not paid-it being patently obvious that the account has not been closed as it was supposed to have been over 6 months ago.My partner is distraught,not long being out of hospital for nearly 6 weeks,and this is everything she can do without.She called 3 and met with intransigence from a foreign call centre-needless to say the experience was a total waste of time with nothing resolved,and very upsetting.I then became involved as I was incandescent with rage when I heard what had transpired. I rang 3 and for around 3/4hr argued with 2 call personnel who I found very difficult to understand to say nothing of demanding again and again that the issue be resolved immediately. I demanded to know where the centre was based,and eventually it was admitted-India-as if I hadn’t already guessed!I also demanded the account be shut immediately,no excuses. Round and round went the argument. I said the letter and demand was harassment and kept demanding the account being shut immediately.I made it clear that I wasn’t taking no for an answer. Eventually I was told it would be 10 days for them to conduct an internal enquiry before shutting the fictitious account. I’ll leave you,the reader,to imagine my response to that!They were roundly told that I didn’t believe a word and if this matter continued beyond the 10 days,I would start down the legal route,citing harassment and a claim for compensation.The whole saga is disgusting and disgraceful and 3 should be taken to court for their appalling lack of any meaningful customer service. They display an incompetency that is mind boggling.I would advise that anyone with an account with 3,close it asap,or at the very least,contact the company regarding their disgusting business ethics.3 is unfit for purpose-and all this hassle from an unwanted and unwarranted intrusion into our personal lives.PS.

If I didn't force the shop to call them for me I have no idea how to reach a human. They're deliberately preventing us to reach customer service by pushing us between live chat and the silly hotline.

I ended a contract in June and had some credit on my final bill, they said it will be automatically refunded, I waited and waited it never came through, I called the customer service who reassured it had now being resolved but still I haven’t received any credit yet. I wasn’t very bothered about the referral bonus because I felt the T and Cs were up to Three anyway but this credit from my final bill is different. Why is it easy to take out money by Direct debit and difficult to refund back into the same account? Once I let go, but a second time , Something Is fishy.

I just think Three make it too easy to complain.My port-in is due today, and after 4hrs since my old provider confirming my account was closed, I inquired via in-app chat with Three how it was progressing. Mistake 1. I was asked questions about the last top up & date, locating this via the app closes the chat, so it's then another attempt. This happened twice.After this, despite giving the agent the same (CORRECT!) replies I gave presented with some form of screenshot that the account was locked for 24hrs and basically nothing they can do. I wasn't advised of this at any point - and all I wanted was info on my port.This meant that not only could I not find out anything about my account, but the status of my port was up in the air for at least 24-hrs, and I had no access to my old number.After finally escalating to a supervisor as not taking no for an answer, they suddenly had access to my account and could confirm the port would be done ""by the end of the day"" whichever day that would be!!! Basically I wasted 2hrs on a simple task, using their inadequate app, speaking with inept staff. I'll be leaving as soon as I join.

The store only deals with sales inquiry and sales refunds. As a customer been with three for more than15 years,  I advice you to not join them. Reason: - network coverage doesn’t cover majority of London, always come across network issue. - customer service via telephone, over promising and mislead you with information- complaints department doesn’t even know what is data protection act is and human rights. I feel sorry the stores as they are selling a product for three for mass production and hitting the regional manager targets to make him/her looks so good. But it’s a shame customer service, complaints, technicians can’t support them with the service. Three told me I would have been able to cancelled my contract with no upfront fee due to data network coverage, and they have provided me all relevant information, phone calls are all recorded. And at the end of it they’ve charged me and said they didn’t agree to a free cancellation fee. I was suppose to have a free data roaming abroad, I had called three service to make sure everything was ok via setting before departure. once I had I arrived my network wasn’t working, I had to pay £260 additional for the phone call to three to rectify my problem.

When calling Three up on that Sunday we was told we could not cancel the phone number and get a new Sim due to a migration they was undergoing that weekend. Which is outrageous, the gang who robbed the phone had full access and could use the phone.When going back into the store in Romford on the 17/07/2023 we got a new sim and asked them to blacklist the old phone. The 19/07/2023 we then called customer service asking for phone of usage, and a blacklist report to send over to the insurance company to replace the old device. They said the report would take up to 72 hours. So we waited. Fast forward to the 24/07/2023 I then called up again asking where these reports were, at this point I was loosing my patience and asked to speak to someone higher up which is where I got through to Sanket.On this conversation he told me that the blacklist had not been done due to missing information. Why was we not contacted for that missing information??He told me that he was prioritizing us and would get this resolved. He then proceeded to tell me we had to wait 48 hours for the phone to be blacklisted and the reports would take another 72 hours. He knew all we needed was those reports. I then asked him to call me on the Wednesday which of course he did not.The phone was blacklisted Tuesday evening and 72 hours from then would have been Friday. It is now Tuesday 1/08/2023 and I'm still waiting for these reports. All they do is lie to you to get you off the phone and don't care. He called me up yesterday ~(Monday) asking for more time - have you not had enough time? This should have been done on Monday 17/07/2023 and if people could do there jobs properly we might actually have these reports.Also not to mention they were charging us an extra £15 a month without us knowing and they're excuse was ""system issue"". No they're trying to scam there own customers. Then he used this against me over the phone saying did he not help me with this refund, well he would of had to because you were stealing from us.I've also chased again via the online chat and now I'm being told the reports will take 7-10 working days. So again, another lie. Getting really frustrating now. Paying for a service provider and there service is not providing. There staff are clueless, and dealt with this situation so poorly. And could only offer 50% refund for this month which I think is also poor.I've asked to speak to someone higher in the company but again, I'm just being fed more lies.Better off going to EE.

Great 4g whilst I had no landline and it was fabulous. Problems only started when I tried to leave. I would hope that my will help people make a decision on whether to buy the MI-FI service from three, it has cause a fair amount of stress, especially if you are not tech savy but need broadband to do stuff in an emergency. Firstly in order to cancel knowing the address it's registered to all your own personal details and account number are not enough to cancel the account, even though it's WIFI no one can do anything without the phone number you do not use and was only provided once in your initial DD set up. I got  instructions on how to access my router to find said number from the Three website, it did not work! so went back to the website to find out how to leave, I set up MY3 (useless and confusing - in the process  I apparently managed to order 2x broadband to one address with one phone line, I thought I was clicking on a link, and did not press any confirmation button, when I was told what had happened - I could not cancel as there was a feedback button over the cancel link, more on that later). I ended up going to google and got an email address wrote an email with 30 days notice, but was sent an email 3 days later telling me I had broadband and needed to email the right team (no information provided on who the right team were) and apparently the generic three email address I had mailed was phone only (but I need a phone number to cancel the broadband remember)... Finally found my DD letter, with my phone number and the phone number of the elusive customer services team. I called them, was pretty happy to be finally sorting this out, at some stage you have to press 3 for upgrades and thinking of leaving us, but then in the next step you can only press 1 for an upgrade, with only that option to me I took it, and after 7 minutes of pushing back upgrades and special deals, I was told they would cancel, except when the guy went to put it through he said he couldn't as I have ordered two lots of broadband to one address with one phone line, and he could only proceed if I cancelled the two broadband myself, but I couldn't as mentioned before there was a feedback button over cancel on the app on my phone, and it wasn't clear that I had ordered anything - it just looked like it was sat in a basket and I had not had any written documentation. Only when I asked to speak to a supervision and mentioned cool off period (it happened over two days), and maybe having to get further legal advice as to take things further, did this get resolved, goodness knows how this company can operate in this way and pass a social audit, I am not bad with tech and I got caught out. Incidentally I looked to see if the same thing could happen with my current mobile phone provider, and the answer was a solid no, I would have had to gone through 4 screens where it was clearly labelled and clicked on ok/ confirm 3 times. The guy did say ""just for you"" he cancelled the current contract and the two pending contracts (for which I hadn't seen any agreements, written confirmations, email etc - so still not sure how true any of this is), but one still says pending so I will have to keep a watch out.... if it's not sorted then I will take it further, if it is sorted then great... but it still doesn't sit well with me, my parents could have done this and been none the wiser until it hit their accounts.

After 25 minutes of unsuccessful online chat, I phone up waiting to speak to an agent for 40 MINUTES, eventually I got through they would not accept my name as the person registered to the account. I argued and argued, gave them the account number I had been provided, provided them with the security check code from my emails. Turns out store lady, despite me using my first name to fill in all forms and sign, she copied my MIDDLE name from my drivers licence and used that for their records. I told myself, it's just for 30 days, breathe. Device never worked but I won't cry over £35, it could have been worse. I had set up direct debit when in store from my bill paying debit card account so I just assumed it would sort itself out. Noticed in my emails that I had received a bill for month 2 (strange I thought, I had signed for 30 days, pulled up my contract to double check and found that the agreement was 30 days). Tried to log in to rectify situation, same rigmarole ""please provide mobile number"", don't have one, ""please provide name"" etc etc. Eventually get through to chat agent after about an hour, requests he cancels the account, he tells me that because they require notice, the account will close after next month. I said ""not a chance"", proceeded to explain I had evidence from contract in my hand, tune changed and he agreed to cancel contract.

There was no problem with the signal where I was, and no evidence of a missed call on my phone. Some of the staff in customer service seem very good, but it feel like pot luck who you get. Some seem to be very poorly trained and struggle with basic competence, and also being able to speak clearly. # Very poor customer service",Negative,-0.086458333

Their automated systems are broken or at worst deceptively built in such a way that makes it difficult to cancel.Contract ended on 30/06/2023 and put onto a rolling contract.  I try to log into my account to cancel at that point but my e-mail address/login no longer works and I have to set up a new one.Couldn't get this set up - wasn't getting the codes through needed to.Try to phone Three on their automated line - they have an option to Cancel contract - but when I went on it I got a line saying ""Your contracted ends 2023"" and only gives only 2 options - Upgrade or Renew.  No way to break out of that menu option without calling them again.Try and call them on their customer service line but after 20 minutes on hold I get no where and I have to go back to work.A few days later I try again - same problem - can't get through to anyone on the phone - it disconnects after being on hold.  I then speak to someone on chat through their website, explain multiple times I want to cancel - get transferred through multiple people.  I thought at that put all was done.... BUT .. A new direct debit has gone out.Today I have now finally been able to access my ""account"" ? And It says nothing of the cancellation!Absolutely furious.. so I try to phone again. Get through to a customer service agent who asks me to explain everything - then immediately puts me on hold for 5 minutes without saying anything.  She then asks me again!? - and immediatetly back on hold without a word.Sat on hold now on this call for 25 minutes+No idea what they're doing.Trying to charge me for a service I've not used in months.- Update - I ended up on that latest call for another 20 minutes until it disconnected.Rang back to their sales line as I hoped htat would immediately go straight through to a real person and not deal with the BS phone systems that don't work.  Explained the situation, she seemed OK but then started quizzing me on my other phone contract services and phisning for sales opportunties.  fair enough i did call the sales line but i was obviously audibly stressed out and only phoned to try and get put through to an actual human i could speak with. Like seriously WHY IS IT SO HARD TO CANCEL A SODDING CONTRACT anywayshe eventually puts me through to someone in the team that can cancel the contract.. oh god that was an experience in of itself.  and included EVEN MORE trying to sell me stuff. putting so much pressure on.. like NO, i don't want to pay an extra £20 for the same service with a worse handset.then came to cancellation.. took another 10 minutes of me pleading for them to take the cancellation from when they actually got my request to cancel it over a month ago.. and eventually they didi am probably still going to be charged something for not canceling in May before the 2 year was up and they threw me onto the rolling contract, which is stupid enough in of itself considering NONE OF THEIR AUTOAMTED SYSTEMS TO DO THIS WORK AND TRYING TO SPEAK TO HUMANS THERE IS STRESSFUL complained to ofcom about this whole process of cancelling being a nightmarelike.. seriously..

However when I said I wanted to close the account , they directed me to the shop to close the account, because I could not verify the mobile number since it was a tablet! However, when I rang up customer service number they could not verify my account envisage the my D.O.B did not correlate to the one on the account. Funny that I was able to verify it before. I wasted a lot of time on the phone trying to verify it and they could not verify the account using other information on the account and their excuse is that some one may have open the account instead of me. I eventual had to go to store, which was not convenient. They rectified the issue of the wrong information on my account. Then they directed my to the customer service on the phone again, as they could not sort out my issue. The customer service is inefficient and convoluted and disadvantages the customer.

Signal strength and data speeds seem to be up and down like a yoyo both indoors and outdoors but consistently slow data speeds regardless, slightly faster speeds at night/early morning but not by much.

We only used it for 30 min. And then packed it up ready to send back. It is impossible to speak to a person on 3. Waited on hold for over 30 min. Then gave up and so I managed to find their address and posted it back to them with a letter stating that I want to end the contract only for them to ignore my request and post the 5G HUb back to me with no reason as to why I could not cancel as I was in the 14 day cooling off period. I had signed up for a one month rolling contract and they are continuously billing me every month even though I am not using this and had tried to send it back. Their automated system will not let you speak to a person and just sends you round and round in circles leaving you more and more frustrated by the minute. Even if you write a letter as I did which I sent with the returned 5G hub they will ignore your requests to cancel , even if you are in the 14 day cooling off period. This company is so desperate to hold on to their customers that they make it impossible for a customer to speak to anyone at Three to cancel their contract and I suspect that even if you are persistent and manage to speak to a Three rep you will probably e cut off once they know you want to cancel your contract . I am constantly being targeted by online and phone line scammers and now I have found one “THREE” that has found a loophole where they can SCAM people legitimately. I have now cancelled the direct debit so these scammers can not take any more of my money .

Three,4,GB,1,Blatant Fraud,19-Jul-23,c1121e85-55d5-4480-ab88-4d7ae6fff778,"Recently moved in to a house without a readily installed socket for traditional broadband, so decided to give Three 5G broadband a go. It claims to have a 30 day money back ‘guarantee’ for your ‘peace of mind’.Despite the hub showing we have 5G signals most of the time, the download speed (around 30mb/s) was nowhere near advertised, and the upload speed was always below 2mb/s. I work from home regularly and with such upload speed it was impossible for Teams call. Decided to cancel after a couple of weeks but well before 30 days. Contacted online live chat first, started by their nonsense ‘troubleshooting steps’ which were not much more than ‘turn it off and turn it back’. Eventually customer service appeared to agree to cancel, said the service would stop the same day and promised a return label via email within 16 hours. No cancellation confirmation arrived, service still running and obviously no return label in the email.This time I decided to call their customer service. Told them I’ve requested cancellation and asked to check my cancellation status. I was told while they could see a comment added to my profile that I requested cancellation, it has not been processed at all. Agreed to initiate cancellation again over the phone. Same promise - service would stop the same day and and a return label via email within 16 hours. It was 24 hours later. You’ve probably guessed it, service was still running and no return label via email. There wasn’t even an email or message confirming they have received my cancellation request.From reading from customers with exact the same experience, it is obvious that despite the falsely misleading promises of doing so, Three have no real intention to process the cancellation request. It is part of their planned fraudulent tactics to delay cancellation as long as possible, to either make customers give up or delay it beyond money back guarantee period. This will enable them to lock you into a 24 month contract, issue bills and the hound you down for the payment. For some reason, such unfair and fraudulent practice, which is in clear breach of Consumer Protection From Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 and thus committed a criminal offence, has been allowed to go on for so long.I then raised a complaint to Three and Ofcom, and contacted their executive office with the same complaint. Got a call back from their executive office the next day. This time I received another promise that a return bag will be delivered within the next 5 working days, and finally got a email confirmation that they have initiated the cancellation and I don’t owe them & will not owe them any money. Currently still waiting to see if a return bag will arrive in the next 3 days. I’m not hopeful, as the internet is, as expected, still running, although I’ve disconnected all my devices just in case. If the bag arrives I’ll stop here and never deal with this company again. If not, or if I ever receive any bills from Three, I will hound these despicable scammers down through all legal means possible before I enter my grave. I’ve also been on a Three SIM only deals for more than 8 years. Will now take it to another provider regardless of the early termination charge there. for their mobile phone service ? Cheap and crap.

Three,1,GB,1,Unfit for purpose,22-Jul-23,afa304c6-17cb-49cb-aa12-ca2666b8452e,"I’ve had their 4g broadband since dec 21. I also have 4g broadband from O2 in the same house. 02 never buffers when streaming TV. Three buffers to the point of being unwatchable - the tv program often just stops because the buffering goes on for so long.Three only works ok after midnight which is not really much use to me. This is because they use a traffic management system called Trafficsense (3pm to Midnight) which throttles down speeds to manage demand during the day - hence the buffering. 02, on the other hand, do not throttle.Three may be cheap, but the service is often unusable for streaming. It is therefore a worthless service to many people. They don’t tell prospective customers how limitations in their network will affect their experience. They are misleading the consumer and this should be brought to the attention of Ofcom.Three, as you might expect, are denying that they throttle speeds during the day. However, their own web site states 'In times of high congestion we might need to take steps such as rerouting bandwidth from quieter places to places with higher demand'. In other words, when the network is busier, the bandwidth jam is spread more thinly amongst users.I'm not sure, but I suppose you might get away with it sometimes when they're throttling, but only on a streaming service like Netflix which reduces the picture quality to SD if the user has insufficient bandwidth for HD or 4K. So, if you have an HD/4K tv and pay for HD/4K streaming service, using Three will undermine your ability to benefit from it.Three was late to the party and has a much smaller 10% market share than its rivals O2 and EE (30% plus each). It has been trying to elbow it’s way in with cut price deals, but remains a sub-scale business. It only has a 1 or 2% return on capital and cannot support sufficient investment without becoming bigger. Hence it’s proposal to merge with Vodafone who are also somewhat sub-scale at 20%. Unless and until this happens, it’s service will remain below par.

However, I have recently discovered that I have been continuously billed for this cancelled service over the ensuing months.In addition, I have noticed that there seems to be no accessible portal for me to view or obtain my invoices, making it difficult for me to track and manage my account effectively. This has inadvertently contributed to the ongoing billing issue, as I was unable to promptly identify the incorrect charges. Upon contacting Mr. Leslie regarding the aforementioned problem, I regret to say that the manner in which he dealt with the situation left me feeling undervalued as a customer. I perceive that his defensive and unapologetic approach, which culminated in him terminating our phone conversation prematurely, was not in line with the standard of customer service that I have come to expect from your esteemed company. I understand that no organisation is infallible and that errors can occur. However, I firmly believe that a humble and apologetic approach during such occurrences could help maintain a positive relationship with the customers.I kindly request that a member of your customer support team the phone conversation I had with Mr. Leslie on the 21st of July, 2023 at 14:56 pm. I believe that this could provide valuable insights into areas where communication and service could be improved.I would appreciate it if you could look into the aforementioned billing discrepancy as soon as possible and make the necessary adjustments to my account. Further, I am hopeful that steps can be taken to enhance your customer service and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.Thank you for taking the time to address my concerns.

I initially thought 3 was the ideal company for my disabled wife’s emergency phone. There was no mention of minimum use on the envelope containing the sim (this has now changed) and the website clearly says “this balance will not expire!! This is not true. Since 2017 my wife had no problems and we could and or top up her account if necessary. I went to look at my account this week could not get in and was told I had to re-register (absolutely no emails or texts telling us they were doing this). Total disaster process, as login/register page kept defaulting to login and kicked me out. Wasted an hour until got it sorted with a weaker password than previously because the idiot system would not accept the previous number of letters/symbols.

Don't touch with a barge pole. 3 months ago my router broke and so we had to cancel the contract and start a new one to get a new router. That itself was a challenge as the sales team were keen sign us up to a new contract, then told us to ring their cancellation team to cancel. Once you get through to the team they are trying to stop us from cancelling even though we are literally staying with three. They were even trying to get us to cancel the new contract we took out. The teams were working against themselves for their own targets - making my customer experience :(. I sent back the router, and have been hounded ever since by three saying they haven't received it even though every time I talk to customer services they look on the system and can see it's been returned. I have now received a message from the debt collection service to say I owe money, when i don't. Thankfully i still have the tracking number and receipt for posting my router, but this will likely cause issues to my credit rating. When calling up customer service, as I am calling from my three mobile, which is a separate account, i have to input the number of the broadband. They repeat that number back and say hit '1' if correct, it then thinks i have said no it isn't correct and so it goes around in loops, even when I hit '2'. It is so frustrating that they can't even get the simplest of customer service experiences correct. Not to mention if they call me up and ask for my personal details to verify the account and I don't want to give these out to some random person that has called me, they won't tell me what the call is about and they tell me to call them back - even though they are the ones who called me with an issue. Naturally I don't because I would rather stick pins in my eyes. Every time I talk to someone they say the issue is solved and low and behold two weeks later, it arises again. It's like being in an abusive relationship. Beyond this issue, if the internet works and you never need customer service, then great, but when the connection isn't stable and there are problems (which we have had frequently over the years) then talking to customer service is the most painful experience.

I can not log into my account as there are so many “something went wrong” errors.

It was really really hard to cancel. Never again. What on earth ?? No contract means no contract. I would never have signed up to a contract as I was leaving the country.

And when I checked back in my email about the new agreement I was supposed to pay £6 a month but three have been overcharging me the whole time.The first payment was fine but in the second month three bumped that up to £13, they then charged me £11 for the next 3 months then £11.22for the next 3 months after that. I was warned about a price hike in April of 4.5% so I understand the last price update , but I am so angry about being overcharged then being made to pay 2 months more … and it took over 2 hours of me digging to find all this out swapping sims around to get through the various hoops with my bank and three etc, and to try and negotiate with the chat, I am still not sure if it was a robot with a computer says no setting or a person with the same setting… # Awful experience trying to cancel",Negative,-0.014366883

We needed to cancel the 4G as the coverage was not good enough to cope with Microsoft teams call reliably, and this was the point we started to discover the extent of the problems with 3. Issues:- We were never sent an email copy of contract- We were not told that we could request the paper copy until after it had been destroyed - so how do I get to see the contract, do 3 even have a copy?- Incorrectly let my flatmate sign her copy of the contract - found out should not have been possible when the account was in my name. We would not have taken the second SIM if we had known thisWhen it came to cancelling the 4G, I understand that all 3 sims were refunded, and then the 2 mobile sims were re-added. This seems unnecessary and has made reading the billing very difficult for the first 4 months  Next issues: Splitting out one SIM to a new accountIn store when taking out the contract we explicitly asked whether one SIM could be split out to an account and we have the note the employee wrote us explaining to wait three months. It also states on the website this is possible, and the complaints department have confirmed this. We have no guarantee however that we won’t end up in the same situation on calling up that the call centre will tell us it’s not possible - its a waste of our time IssuesNo way to talk to a human using the automated flow to enquire Told upon getting through to someone it would not be possible Took 3 weeks to get a written response to say it should be possible from the complaints department.

Website frequently broken - always takes multiple attempts to log inApp - statement breakdowns are really unclear Live chat - Barely ever seems to work - either down, too busy, or crashes mid convo   Travel abroadYou get bombarded with texts when you arrive abroad - telling you to check different places for usage and how to buy more dataThe usage texts are unclear as to whether they refer to the unlimited sims fair usage, or the travel Add ons usage You don’t get data warnings until 80%-90% - that’s just too late and you can’t gauge your usage - in my flatmates case she received the 80% and maxed out text messages at the same time so the system seems flawed. Cannot use the app to see your usage of the add-on ?! Got a daily text saying the add on was active PROVIDED the fair usage wasn’t exceeded. Why not just tell me what my remaining usage with it is - it was not providing the right information Website and app didn’t provide a clear explanation - this information needs improving.  Dreading to see what the July bill is because of this travel abroad data confusion. Overall the communication has nose-dived since I last took out a contract, the online services are broken an unreasonable amount of the time and there is no way I will be staying with 3 when my contract is up. # Gone so downhill since 2021",Positive,0.010539923

In June 2023 I wanted to cancel my contract as the service at my address was poor so I hardly used it. When the contract expired I went online to cancel the contract.  At this point I was offered a great deal with a 5g hub. I thought I would give it a go so I said yes but I wanted my payment to go out on my pay day. I was told it would and all seemed well, this was ALL done on chat.  A couple of weeks later payment was requested on the 4th of the month and unfortunately it failed, as I wasn't expecting it, and because of this my service was suspended. This was not what I had agreed so I went back on chat to cancel my contract in the 30 day period.   The team at three quickly took my payment, agent was Rehan, but to cancel I had to be transferred to a specialist team. I was put onto Sujan who went on to say I had to call a specialist cool off team. I told them I was unable to talk on the phone due to disability.  After a while I was transferred again to Sean at customer wellness team as they could help me.  Upon reading the file Sean transferred me back to customer services without even talking to me. Durai received my chat and told me again that I would have to call the relevant team or get a Family member to contact them on my behalf. I was unwilling to pass on my information to a family member and asked why I couldn't just cancel my account in the 30 day cool off period online in the same easynway that I was able to renew. I also made it clear again that I only wanted to cancel my contract.  After a short wait Durai informed me that they had spoken to a supervisor and explained the situation and that permission was given for them to be able to enter the relevant system to cancel the contract.  DURAI then went on to explain that I had to return the device and that avreturns bag would be sent to my home address.  Durai went out of their way to insure that they could help me on chat and for this point only I give thev2 stars and a WELL DONE to Durai. The whole chat went on from 13.12pm to15.01pm nearly 2 hours. Why can't the 30 day cancellation team be available on chat? It's easy enough to go online to order so why is it not as easy to leave.

I checked the tracking information which said ‘return to co-signer requested’ I spoke to three several times to understand why my order had been cancelled and no one had any idea why and told me that I would receive a call to help me. I never received this call so contacted three who told me to place the order again, which I did not do as I didn’t want to be charged. They said they would forward me onto someone who works at the highest point of escalation. This person then told me that there is a security problem with my account so I need to go in store to get a pin which I did. They also informed me that my order was completed to which I showed them the screenshot of DPDs failed delivery and the updates. I had to attend a three store very far away in an unfamiliar area and upon leaving the store I noticed that my phone had been disabled. I could not receive or make calls or use the internet which put me in a very dangerous situation as I struggled to get home with no service. Upon getting home and speaking with three again they advised that they could not help me and I have to wait 5 working days for another advisor to get back to me. As my phone is unable to receive calls the advisor will not be able to contact me at all so it seems this issue will never be resolved and I will continue to pay for a device I do not have. I now have an unusable phone which I need to use for work and a new missing iphone 13, which no one can help me retrieve.

I checked my spend cap and credit limit with them at the same time. Assured all were OK, which they are. Then I get a similar problem days later. This time the problem is a data roaming limit that is arbitrarily set to £45. This is ok if roaming in Europe at £2 a day, but not if you are anywhere else at £5 a day for 2 weeks!  As they have no support 24/7 if you are in a different time zone you can only get hold of them at certain times.

Three customers need to be aware that when roaming there are, to our knowledge, 3 limits that can block your roaming : 1) spend cap limit (ensure this is high enough in my three app) 2) credit limit - you have no visibility of what is set for you unless you ask, 3) data roaming limit - again you have no visibility of this and even their staff don't seem to know to check this, else it should have been mentioned in our earlier call with them to check our accounts.

I called three to explain to be told that phone was on it’s way back to three and they couldn’t redeliver but I would have to cancel that contract and set up a new one with sales. I declined because I didn’t have time to go through what seems like a really silly process and asked them to cancel the upgrade. It took nearly an hour of phone calls to get to this point and I’m still not convinced it’s been cancelled. I don’t understand how when the delivery service you contract don’t deliver and the error is very definitely with them how you cannot simply send a new phone? That would mean I have a contract with you for a phone I don’t have. Anyway, I’ve ordered with another provider, it took minutes to set up online and delivery was next day with no issues.

NOT only this they have NOW decided that they are going to charge you 10% when you've been cut off to make a payment if you need your phone to transfer money etc etc as you may not have WiFi wherever you are. When you say you can't pay until a certain day they then THREATEN (yes threaten as they did to myself) that they would send bailiffs to my door even though I never said I could not make said payment to them I just asked for an extention to a set day and would be paid in full.

See below for the outline of my awful experience with your company so far. I ordered a 5g Home Broadband Service on 09/02/2023 as your website told me that I would have excellent coverage and would be able to achieve high speeds. However, this was not the case. I phoned Three Customer Services on the 17/04/2023 and spoke to the technical team who apologised for the lack of service and told me that I wouldn't be charged going forwards as they were sending me a jiffy bag to send my home hub back in. There was a note put on my account that I wouldn't be charged any more money at all. The jiffy bag never arrived. I then phoned Three again on the 27/04/2023 to ask why it hadn't been sent. I got passed between 4 different departments until someone then PROMISED me that I would have the jiffy bag within 7 working days and that I would not be charged at all. Surprise surprise the bag NEVER arrived. Just a note that at this point I have spent 3 hours on the phone to 5 different multiple teams. On the 17/05/2023 I then received an email telling me that my bill was ready. I was told previously that my contract was cancelled and all I needed to do was send back my hub in the jiffy bag, WHICH STILL DIDN'T arrive. So I then phoned Three Customer Services on 17/05/2023 to make a complaint that my jiffy bag had not arrived and I was about to be charged. After spending 2 hours on the phone to all of your many many teams I was then told that I wouldn't be charged as it was Three's mistake and then PROMISED that I would receive a jiffy bag within 7 working days. I asked to speak to the complaints department, but I was told that they couldn't get hold of them. What a surprise. 02/06/2023, still no jiffy bag, even after 7 working days. So AGAIN, I phoned Three Customer Services to complain. Again, the man on the phone told me that I couldn't speak to the Complaints team and that he would be able to solve my issue for me. SHOCK... he couldn't. Again, he promised me that the jiffy bag would be sent and we could put a close to this terrible saga that has at this point dragged on for over a month. 19/06/2023.. I then receive an email telling me that my bill is ready! At this point, I am utterly livid at the sheer incompetence of the customer services department. So, again I phoned Three customer services department on the 22/06/2023 and this time eventually got through to the Complaints Team. I spoke with Danish Quereshi. He promised me that the jiffy bag would be with me in 7 working days and that I wouldn't get charged at all as it has been going on for so long and it's not my fault. I have checked my bank account this morning and have seen that Three have taken the money out of my account!? It has been over 2.5 months since I first raised this and Three told me I would NOT get charged any money. I have spent over 6 hours now on the phone to your incompetent teams being passed from 1 team to another none with any clue on how to deal with the issue properly. The only process has been an utter farce from start to finish and I hope that you will understand how angry I am and refund my money, give me compensation for all the stress you have caused and the time I have taken contacting you and most importantly, close my account so I never ever have to deal with you again. # NEVER USE THREE",Positive,0.026203704

As a customer, I have been consistently let down by their poor internet service and the false promises they make every time technical issues arise in my area.To begin with, the reliability of Three Company's internet service is abysmal. It seems that any time I need a stable and uninterrupted connection, their service fails me. It's incredibly frustrating to constantly experience slow speeds, frequent outages, and unreliable connections. I rely heavily on the internet for work, and Three Company's service has consistently hindered my productivity and caused unnecessary stress.What makes matters worse is the way Three Company handles technical issues. Every time I report a problem, I'm met with empty promises and false reassurances. Their customer service representatives consistently assure me that the issue will be resolved promptly, yet nothing changes. The problem persists, and I find myself stuck in an endless cycle of reporting the same issues over and over again.I have lost count of the number of times I have contacted Three Company's customer support, only to receive vague responses and meaningless apologies. Their lack of transparency and accountability is truly disheartening. It's evident that their priority lies in acquiring new customers rather than providing reliable service to their existing ones.The most frustrating aspect is that Three Company seems to have no regard for the inconvenience and frustration they cause their customers. There is a severe lack of communication regarding the progress of issue resolution, leaving us in the dark about when the problems will be fixed. This lack of transparency is a clear reflection of their negligence and disregard for customer satisfaction.It is disheartening to see a company make grand promises of excellent internet service, only to consistently fall short and deceive its customers. I expected more from Three Company, but I have learned the hard way that their marketing claims do not align with reality.In conclusion, my experience with Three Company's internet service has been nothing short of a nightmare. Their poor service quality, frequent outages, and deceptive promises have left me feeling frustrated and cheated. I strongly advise potential customers to reconsider choosing Three Company as their internet service provider, as they are far from reliable or trustworthy. # Frustrating Experience with Three Company's Internet Service and Deceptive Promises",Negative,-0.070459699

I was told it may be problem with my new network provided O2 as they did incorrect number move which causes issues now. So I contacted O2 and they told me they do not have number 6018. Three sent me PAC code but it is only for moving three number to O2. I do not want that 6018 number. Why I would want to proceed with that? I already use new number for last few months.Three has been cold, pretending that it is my fault. That I didn't request cancelling contract with them. O2 says it is automatically cancelled once you move numbers. I am so confused as to what to do. They illegally charge me, I may need to contact Citizens Advice and ombudsman-service as this looks like never ending issue with them.Now I will go to chat, worst chat service I have ever experienced and will try to put things to end. Do not ever think about going with Three. Terrible customer service and worst company to be with.

Three,2,GB,1,Very poor service,17-Jun-23,c6d29a9b-6854-4adf-837d-d34c2d9cacce,"Very poor service. I have been with 3 since it first began at the back of a Superdrug shop. Service I received today was unbelievable. 3 attempts to call three customer service, one call lasted 35 minutes before being disconnected, second call 15 minutes and third call 1 hour 45 minutes, on hold for a lot of it. They said the issue was strange, they had no answers and told me to take it to the 3 shop. So ended the call and headed to the 3 shop. Greeted by a gentleman named Rubin who tried to tell me everything i already knew. They then called customer service, who told me there was a issue with signal in my postcode area but could not tell me WHY I didn’t have signal in data in the middle of town or in the 3 shop. They told me they didn’t have the answer to factory reset my phone which I have already done, told me they replace SIM card, had 4 replacement sims in 3 weeks, clearly not the SIM, tried to blame the phone, Apple customer care checked phone a week ago, issue was not with the phone. The data and unlimited calls, texts etc show in my account but I can not use them, 3 stated this and also said they didn’t have the answer either. I’m paying for minutes, data and I can not access it. 5 weeks tomorrow I have had a mobile that can only be used like a landline phone and 3 response is, there’s a issue with connection in your postcode area, it doesn’t answer why I can not use it anywhere at all and phone calls drop after 2 minutes as the signal goes and data is non existent. They were very rude and the man in the three store rolled his shoulders when I asked what do I do. Left the 3 shop no wiser to when I walked in 48 minutes previous.Looking into changing network, no point of a mobile if it has to be on WiFi just to receive calls, as the signal so poor, phone calls automatically divert to voicemail. 5 weeks I been asking 3 for answers and today they basically held their hands up and said they do not know what to do and wished me a pleasant day.

I have put in so many complaints to the customer service's team and hear absolutely nothing back, I've been without a phone since Dec 2023 and even after speaking with the upgrade team to see if that's an option, they're vague and rude on the phone and it feels as though no one wants to help.

From day one, when engineers from Kelly Communicatuioins arrived to do the cabelling they left without finishing the job. Between them and OpenReach and Vodafone there appeared to be zero communication...the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing. After a week of helpline calls to India, Egypt and one other country, the problem was still not resolved. (I would like to compliment all the staff in India and Egypt for their friendliness even though they could not resolve the issues). After cancelling my contract, and having received at least two emails from Vodafone to say they would send a package for me to return their equipment, nothing arrived in the post. I ended up taking the equipment to my local Vodfone shop. I sent a letter by post (recordrd/signed for) to the head of Vodafone to try and resolve issues but did not receive a reply. Avoid Vodafone at all costs. Having cancelled the Vodafone contract, I signed up with Virgin Media and the whole process ran like clockwork.

I spend money I don't have going to this store only to be told that they need it for 4 days and can't take it without me booking an appointment.

After discussing that my property is eligible for full fibre we then agreed on a package and price and settled on that, bear in mind it took nearly 2 hours but I was ok with that. I was told to check the progress on the update website if I needed more info. Anyways, a few days went past and my next door neighbour who also signed up with Vodafone full fibre said that his order got cancelled on the website. So I put in my order number in and found out that mine was cancelled as well! So I rang them up and after getting transferred to different departments and 2 hours in we finally sorted it out, jobs a good’un. But wait it doesn’t end there, I checked again after a few days and it got cancelled again! My next door neighbour who signed up 2 days after me is going live this week coming and has already received his equipment ( my house is in the middle of a row of terraced houses) and another neighbour 4 doors down is on sky full fibre. So I was going to ring them after work but I received a message saying your broadband has been cancelled and that I cannot receive full fibre at this address.

Vodafone,7,GB,1,Shocking customer service Do not go with Vodafone!,Updated 15 Feb 2024,a5a1ff80-603f-4629-b376-83bfc2fda417,I hope I can save someone else from ever going through what I have been through with Vodafone!I now have an update for the below review. I am extremely disappointed to say that the same issues with the account remain. I have now spent days trying to sort this out. I received a msg to contact customer service the last time I posted the review. However they are as much use as a chocolate tea pot. I have now cancelled my phone contract as I honestly cannot afford to spend any more time speaking to incompetent staff. I never want to have anything to do with Vodafone ever again!!!!Went into Kingston Upon Thames branch and spoke to Vinay who managed to totally mess up a transfer of bank account details. This should be a simple task however he created 2 separate accounts and set up a pay as you go sim. Definitely not what I request. I have spend 3 days trying to sort this out. Every time I call I am told something different. No one seems to know what they are doing at all.

I specifically inquired about the implications of such a reset and was assured that only the password would revert to default settings. Unfortunately, this guidance was misleading as the reset erased all my customized settings, leaving me with the task of reconfiguring everything from scratch.This incident highlights a critical need for clearer communication and accurate information from customer support. It's disheartening to face additional hurdles due to incomplete advice. I hope my feedback encourages the company to improve their support process, ensuring future customers receive comprehensive and precise guidance to avoid similar frustrations.Moving forward, I urge the company to provide detailed instructions and support for backing up and restoring settings before recommending a factory reset. Customer trust relies heavily on the quality of support provided, and there's definitely room for improvement based on my recent experience.****************************************************If your support had informed me in advance about the issues that could arise after a factory reset or had followed up on the work, I would have opted not to address the previous problem of insufficient download/upload speeds. This is because the issue of the router losing its settings after a factory reset is more significant than the problem of inadequate download/upload speeds.

It is still open and still affecting my credit score even though the account has been settled in full. Terrible service. Vodafone Business. I have been trying to close a business account for 8 weeks. I have paid up the account in full but Vodafone have still not closed the account. As crazy as it seems, this is negatively affecting my credit score. I have spent over 2.5 hours on the phone during 3 calls to the business team. I have requested to be escalated to a manager, and I keep being told their is no manager available on shift - no manager on shift at a company the size of Vodafone, like I am supposed to believe that. If you are considering a phone or any other service from Vodafone I strongly suggest you go to EE, Smarty or Three. I have never known a service as bad as this. Some saving grace! Whilst writing this review an amazing customer service agent by the name of Nada has managed to get the account closed.

I called Vodafone who said I had to give 30 days notice and told me the final amount £6.82 this was paid in full and my contract ended, I have all emails.Afterwards I took a call from an abrupt lady demanding £20.75, I explained and she said so you don't want to pay for services you have had, I explained again, then she ended the call.I then started to receive debt letters, so I called them and explained everything, they said they would speak to their client and I forwarded all communications, I never heard anything.Recently I needed a mortgage and went to my bank of over 35 years, they declined me and said maybe its your credit score, so I ran a report.Shocked to find that Vidafone had put this against me and its on my report.I'm amazed at their total disrespect to resolve a small issue, their heavy handed ways and that after many years would stoop so low.I want Vodafone to resolve thus and remove this from my records, you have caused me a lot of problems now. # I was with Vodafone a/c 7042176267 home…",Positive,0.034375

Vodafone,6,GB,4,Miscarriage of justice (part 3),Updated 10 Feb 2024,e40bfc70-8336-4e93-bf36-5978c1e10236,"IMPORTANT UPDATE:Wow! Amazingly and most surprisingly I have had to come and update because Vodafone (and I believe the agent was Jasmine - THANK YOU!) have - in an unusual turn of events - absolutely COME THROUGH!I was feeling so cynical and jaded about this situation (see below) but they not only cleared his file, they also updated it immediately and within one day, his credit score has been redeemed. He has gone from POOR to EXCELLENT over night and I can only say thank you to the team who actually sorted this out. It’s easy to lose hope in big business but in this case, Vodafone have put things right. With integrity, I can only raise to four stars because it has been a to-do and it could have been much more efficient and precious time, energy and emotional output could have been saved…But I am still very grateful and my prayers have been answered. Thank you. 🙏 OLD REVIEW:Unfortunately, Vodafone have really let us down. My stepson took out a contract nearly three years ago with a cooling off period and he returned the phone to them within the 14 days. They continued to try to take money (£70) from his account at the time despite the contract having stopped. He has been unaware of a £36 debt that has now been defaulting for nearly three years since. He and his wife and new baby are on the verge of a move to the UK from abroad for Isaiah to start a new job and he opened his credit report to find that his low score was NOT (as he had thought) for being out of the country and not on the electoral roll but because of a £36 debt to Vodafone that he was unaware of.With a 5.5 hour time difference and very slow responses from Vodafone AND mixed messages about his credit file (with one person on FB saying there was NOTHING he could do while another on Instagram was saying he COULD file a dispute and that they COULD look at his credit file) he paid the outstanding debt on 30th Jan and raised a dispute.However, a further failing from Vodafone has meant that his credit report has been updated on Feb 1st (2 days after paying the outstanding and debatable default) and it is STILL THERE!!! With the credit report on Experian reporting that he has defaulted AGAIN… which he has not!!!Anyone who knows the current market in the UK knows that a watertight credit report is - understandably - essential for a landlord’s peace of mind and he is stuck with this apparent default (which no longer exists but has rolled on for yet another month on his record) and a “high risk” on his credit report because Vodafone have still not responded nor updated his details to Experian, Equifax and Transunion. This is such poor customer service. I am dumbfounded and so saddened.He is due to start his new job in the UK next month and is saddled with a “high risk” issue on his credit report because Vodafone have not updated his credit file despite him having paid the £36.I am so concerned for my dear family and new baby grandson and so disappointed that Vodafone have let them down over such a piffling situation. It puts them in such a vulnerable situation with potential landlords and he has done due diligence to sort it out.The many five star reviews suggest stellar customer service… but this is clearly reserved for those taking out a contract - there is no such speed and accuracy when it comes to helping to sort out a situation when someone has been wronged.Disappointed is an under statement.PLEASE sort this out Vodafone for the sake of a young family who need a break. # Miscarriage of justice (part 3)",Positive,0.091092949

Over 18 months ago my wife and I decided to move to Thailand to live a nomad lifestyle. I understand that vodafone doesn't cover Thailand under my red max unlimited contract. I asked if it could be paused until I return.It couldn't, but I completely understand as I signed a contract, I continue to pay the bill and run the contract out. But, i asked for it to be cancelled as soon as the contract was up (around 12 months). 18 months later and I notice double the amount coming out of my bank account every month from vodafone. After an arduous conversation with their chat bot, i finally got hold of a real person. I ask for the contract to finally be cancelled and the number moved to pay-as-you-go... but it will cost me another month of rolling contract (that isn't used as the sim line is still turned off on my phone) as I have to give 30 days notice. I mentioned that I gave them 18 months notice, but no record of this conversation can now be found. And they wouldn't investigate until after the contract had been cancelled... So i'm now well over £1400 deep to Vodafone for a service I haven't used with yet another month to pay out of contract. I can't recommend Vodafone, and will looking elsewhere the minute I get back. # Awful experience",Negative,-0.072020202

Vodafone,1,GB,1,I will give ZERO review if possible,05-Feb-24,2f8f62ea-7fce-4fce-9ffe-0cb1e64b8f22,"I will give ZERO review if possible. I signed up for a business broadband contract with Vodafone last October 2023 and every single month till today I have spent over an hour on the phone with customer services to reactive my broadband which was suspended because the direct debit setup and the whole account setup were never completed properly. I have never once received an email or text regarding my account nor a statement in writing via email or post. I have requested these every time I call in but they can readily find my account (after over 7 questions). This is not the frustrating part, as a business every time the broadband is suspended, we are unable to take card payments or bookings for a day or two. Every phone call takes over an hour to resolve the issue, today I spent over 2hrs on the phone with customer services, and each time I had to negotiate an extra £5 charge for late payment due to an error on their side. I have decided to go to another provider because there seems to be no one willing and able to help, including managers who promised a callback but never happened. I hope this helps anyone thinking of signing a contract with Vodafone. # I will give ZERO review if possible",Negative,-0.020378151

Here one rep said that the only answer was to contact VOXI which had already proven to be a dead end for us. At this point SAM entered the picture and treated us to one of the best customer service experiences we have had. He worked with the VOXI system not usually accessed by Vodafone branches to pinpoint several issues with the set up of our account in Cambridge. Ultimately this resolved the problems although not an easy task at all. We recommend SAM be recognized for his technical knowledge and customer service.

Customer services have ‘hung up’ on me 3 times and transferred me to other departments 4 times, meaning this waste of time continued for over 2 hours on the telephone. Vodafone is traditionally the most expensive mobile network but I cannot understand why. It certainly isn’t because of a decent level of customer care. As Vodafone do not wish to refund the money owed, I will be moving away to a different supplier taking all of my numbers with me (5 in total) .

Usually for about 15 mins and whilst you are holding for 30 mins calling the call Center, it comes back. You will never be told why it failed, only that it’s back. Then it fails again. Never an issue their end. The app which they quote as award winning (the award it’s shittist app ever) takes 4 mins to log in. Doesn’t allow you to do anything and is always wrong. It will tell you, you have no internet when you do and your internet is fine when you have nothing. My favourite is they say your WiFi is the issue. Cable doesn’t work either but it’s my WiFi!!!!!  You can’t separate 5ghz and 2.4 so to register cameras etc, you have to walk down the street out of the 5ghz range. This is a major player with absolutely no idea what the consumer wants.

My worst experience every with broadband provider, am so happy for EE. I had vodafone broadband for 2 years than I moved home. I have never missed a payment. When I moved and called to inform them about this I was told I would need a new router as my old one would no longer work. My contract was up anyway so my plan was to start a new contract . I asked them to cancel my current account since the router would not work at my new address and I was told I have an outstanding bill to clear , which means I would be paying for an entire month even though I would not have access to the Internet for that entire month. I was not happy with this so I spoke to a manager and he said me would credit my account the difference.       I waited for the new router they attempted a delivery but I was at work. The next day it was delivered to an address I was living at years ago. So I called to speak to them about it and nothing was done so I called and cancelled the account because I could not wait on the WiFi for over a month and nothing. After this I started getting bills. I called again to explain to them I already cancelled the order I do not have Internet access so I can't owe them money for service I am not receiving. Everytime I called I would be on the phone for hours , I was told all was sort. Weeks later I got letter in the posts regarding outstanding bills and how it will go on record to negatively affect my credit score. I called them again was on the phone for over 3 hours explaining the entire situation again like a broken record. I asked to speak to a manager again as I was so frustrated, everyone I spoke to had a different story as to why I have a balance on my account. When I finally spoke to a manager he told me a different balance than what was in the letter I received. He explained that apart of the balance was for my new account,for which I did not get the router and cancelled the account and the rest as for my old account which I also cancelled and already paid my final bill. He further stated that he would credit my account to take off the amount due on my new account since I did not get the router but he would have to go back and listen to all my calls to find out which of their employees told me I would not be charged again after I paid my last bill. I literally did not know whether to laugh at the rubbish I was hearing or cry over the amount of hours of my time they wasted and them trying to ruin my credit score over their own incompetence. The manager stated that it would take him a few days to listen to my calls so I won't know anything yet. I will continue to tell my story to anyone willing to listen.

Vodafone,1,GB,1,Do not bother going here for any help!!,Updated 2 Feb 2024,62259514-53df-40ea-881a-bfb1ca0811fa,"I had booked an appointment with the ‘tech team’ at the Liverpool Church Road store, to arrive and be abruptly told that there is no tech team in today and that I didn’t need to see someone from that team anyway. I was then sat down with an advisor and an assistant manager, neither of which cared about the issue I had or would let me explain what the problem was fully, just kept interrupting me and being rather rude and unapproachable. After realising they couldn’t do anything they said they would have to do a live chat with the ‘tech team’ - funny considering they had told me 5 minutes ago I didn’t need technical help!! I sat in silence with the advisor for 20 minutes to be told that ‘the issue is now resolved’. When I asked what the problem was that they have now fixed, he was unable to explain to me - I’m pretty sure they didn’t do anything at all!!! When I left I rang vodafone customer service and spoke to a lovely advisor who allowed me to explain my problem and has changed settings on my device and sent me a new SIM to resolve the problems I had.

Vodafone,17,GB,1,Incompetant twice,02-Feb-24,71b290e1-6503-4538-addb-8195fcca2fac,"Always trusted vodafone and wanted to go with their fibre 2 broadband (despite being higher in price). The first order cancelled due to an error on your system which I got an email for asking me to call. I rang and reordered with your team (slighly annoyed because it's an error on your behalf, that should have be sorted by your team but I had to ring and go through everything again). This pushed my delivery and set up for internet back by 5 more days. Now 4 days later, I get a phone call from your team (luckily when I was on a break at work) to say you've cancelled my order because the phone line type was incorrect (i have no email of this or notification alternatively and they have just been ringing for a few days). So I explain, their team member told me which to select if I wasn't sure and filled it in with me on the phone. I request for details of the delivery date, and I can't be told until I have placed the full order again. So after 20 minutes on the call, they the say it's another 10 days after the original is the earliest now. Despite this being another error of theirs (this time their team). Gone to sky, almost cheaper price for the faster internet deal with a booster. And they are coming in 4 days from now rather than 21 days from now (which was the date given by vodafone).

I called them up and the customer rep  had no idea of what she is talking and she first said no we didn't cancel and when i insisted she went to check and came back saying sorry there was a technical glitch , which mean the order is cancelled , i was very unhappy as i got a online discount from quidco when placing that order which now will be cancelled.  The customer care rep had no idea what Quidco is  so it took me 5 min to explain that.  Then she went back and forth to ask their senior question  for everything . I asked her  if i would get a hard check on my credit report , for that she asked me what is hard check and what is credit report. I gave up at that point. Then in the evening i called again to confirm the same , this time i got somebody from local so they understood credit report , and he clearly said ""you are not taking loan from us sir so there will be only soft check on your credit report"" to which i believed .

At point of sales and with two existing mobiles from Vodafone we were convinced to more our broadband service over. We confirmed connection would be at the front of the house as our home office was there. All was confirmed, but when the installers arrived they highlighted connection would be at the back via a 20 meter cable from a telegraph pole. We we assured the Wi-Fi would be of a superior quality to ensure our home office would function productively on the internet.Not the case, woeful connection, poor streaming and dropping off all the time. While we had technical look at this, the only suggestion was a booster which we installed to improve things only slightly. Finally after putting up with an unreliable Wi-Fi service we relocated our office to the kitchen where the router is, plugged in and the service was excellent apart from the odd drop off, the challenge is with such a busy kitchen, it was not idea for our working environment.Frustrated with this work around we agreed to pay the termination fee for an mis-sold service and one where there was little motivation to fix nor accept any responsibility for the poor service.We now have 30days to find a service provider who will meet customer expectations with a delivery of the service we sign up for.With 2 mobile phone contracts it’s now likely we will move them also. # Spent over 2 hours today cancelling the…",Positive,0.091885965

I've just got round to renewing and was told that they have changed how they operate and if I purchase one of the 3rd party provided phones I would not be able to keep my number on the Vodafone network. So the contracts that they sell and outsource for profit are now unwelcome on their network and as a loyal customer I am now left with the rigmarole of finding a new network as I cannot sacrifice my number as it is established in my business.

I was with Vodafone for a number of years and struggled with service issues and internet connectivity. Within my contract I paid for 4G and 5G and only ever had access to 3G. I was told this was an issue with Vodafone due to them having a number of 3G masts remaining within the UK and therefore my phone was unable to connect or use 4G/5G. Despite being aware of these issues Vodafone switched off the 3G network which left me, and I am sure many other people, without internet access despite being charged for it each month. This resulted in me being forced to switch providers and pay for a new device as I could not be without internet due to work. I have been left paying for two phones due to Vodafone switching their 3G network off, therefore I reached out to Vodafone on social media to see if they could write off the remaining balance due on my old phone which they have refused to do.

Vodafone,1,GB,3,2 year Broadband Contact,Updated 31 Jan 2024,0141b39b-0f5f-41b9-9868-bd724fbf14de,"Taken out a 2 year Broadband Service 500Mbs, changing over from BT 100Mbs service. Took about around half a day for the service to start but the VOIP transfer of the phone number from BT took somewhat longer. That doesn't surprise me and I wouldn't jump to conclusions the extra delay in down to Vodafone. Getting a mobile number transferred between operators  generally goes much more smoothly than transfer of landline numbers. I think it's a good deal at least for the contact period, even factoring in the ubiquitous April over inflation price increases that everyone applies. But whilst my phone number is now recognized the phone still doesn't work as they forgot to include a VOIP phone adapter in the equipment they sent me so they are having to now send through a  BS 6312 (BT) female to RJ11 male adapter separately. The order did include wired phone service  so I'm uncertain whether this omission was a mistake OR if they are just trying to penny pinch by excluding the adapter from the package. It's probably not a great idea to let people try to source their own VOIP adaptor, because there are various types with/without low pass filter and with/without ringing capacitor, and use of the wrong type could then lead to further issues.They did send superfluous adaptors for DSL which I don't need as I'm on Optical Fibre now and don't actually have a copper line any longer. In general I think they could save a bit of cost AND give a better service by matching up the equipment they send with the equipment needed for the order.The telephone  support for this problem was OK, but the link they sent via SMS for video call setup (so they could look at the connections on the back of the router) didn't work so well as the web page on the link  wouldn't let me grant permissions to use my smart phone camera whilst the ongoing phone call icon was still on screen in the foreground. So I had to drop the phone call first in order to grant permissions, and was then me on a video call for where I couldn't hear/see any one on the other end. It did the job though and I left the camera pointing at the back of the router and it became clear later that they had seen what they needed to see when they called me back (though the security questions all needed going through again). I've certainly had a lot worse support from other ISPs and was straight through to someone without waiting when I called them. The router they sent is a Technicolor THG3000. Comparable specs to the Sagecom built BT Smart Hub2 that I was using previously. Slightly more intuitive web user interface, I think. But still no 802.11ax (WiFi 6) or WPA3 security option. Would be nice to see movement from WiFi 5 as some operators are now gearing up to roll out routers with WiFi 7. I was hoping for a WiFi 6 based router, but not too surprised that I didn't get one.Update: The VoIP adapter arrived, but it still didn't have a ringing capacitor within it so everything worked apart from my phone not actually ringing when it's receiving a call. However I know the superfluous DSL filter I was sent will have a 1.0 - 1.8 uF capacitance across the 2 wire voice line side. So I connect the VOIP adapter to the router, the DSL filter to the VOIP adapter, and the phone to the voice side of the DSL filter and BINGO the phone now rings. Nothing like the diagram I was sent but it works. I have the advantage of having worked for GEC Plessey Telecoms in the past so I understood what a non ringing phone means and how to fix that. I fear that Vodafone don't understand any of it anymore because everything is outsourced in such a way that the left hand no longer knows what the right is doing and there is less and less technical expertise actually left in the company itself. # 2 year Broadband Contact",Positive,0.070065562

Vodafone,2,GB,1,Broadband (non) install after a move,30-Jan-24,d5035fcb-8236-400b-bd92-264b4a0e0cd1,"I was renting a flat and switched to Vodafone broadband a few months back because they gave me a deal on 900mb fibre to make it the same price as my 500mb from TalkTalk who I was with at the time. I've since bought a house and moved into it on the 15/12/23, Vodafone initially told me that the install would happen at the start of January, I forget which date now because it's been so long, they then told me it would be the 18th. A few days before the 18th I get a call telling me the order had been processed wrongly on the system and for that reason OpenReach had rejected it and a new order had to be created, which it was at the time I can't fault whoever it was that called me on that one. So then someone from Vodafone called back a few days later to sort out an install date, which was supposed to be 1st February (bearing in mind as of today 30th january I've been without internet for 46 days, 16 of which I'm ok to discount because Christmas and New Year). Now I get a call today to tell me basically that the install isn't going ahead as ""Openreach are still waiting for an engineer to be assigned to the job so vodafone will call me back on 6th feb with an update and to set my expectations""... having family that used to work for Vodafone and OpenReach, they've both said it's a failure on Vodafone's side to make sure an engineer was actually booked for the date that Vodafone advised. Honestly I'm sick of having to use my mobile as a hotspot as this house has awful signal and it has to sit in my bedroom window to be of any use, and even then a simple youtube video freezes constantly. I know it's such a first world problem, but internet is no longer a luxury it's a necessity to our lives, so I am undeniably stressed by this whole experience and just want my internet installed before I have to start looking somewhere else which honestly I probably should have done the first time this happened. # Broadband (non) install after a move",Negative,-0.023452782
Vodafone,4,GB,1,No home broadband for almost 3 months and counting,30-Jan-24,92410592-f855-4674-ba30-6fbf8b8bbe94,"Vodafone disconnected my copper internet cable in order to install a fibre optic cable in November 2023. It is now 2024 and the fibre optic cable has still not been installed and the copper cable is completely disconnected meaning I have been without any internet for almost 3 months. I have 0 internet and I have been unable to work from home. Vodafone just tell just tell me that it is not their problem it is the problem of their supplier open reach. Open reach will not talk to me directly. Because my installation has been over 60 days I have reached Vodafones cap on compensation, so I am no longer eligible for any more compensation for having no internet. I have also not received any compensation because Vodafone will only pay me the compensation once my service has been connected but they have failed to connect my service. And it is looking unlikely that my service will ever be connected. I am completely disgusted with Vodafone, how can they leave me in the dark ages with no internet for so long. Vodafone will not take any responsibility for the problem and are not taking any steps to fix it.

I signed up for their clearly advertised Vodafone broadband package running at 910 Mb (*average) last July, guarantee of minimum 450 Mb, this is all false advertising. My system runs at 350-390 almost all the time as checked by their recommended Speed Test software. The poorly paid near-robots they employ as a cost effective obviously overseas ""customer service"" department quote every time they remotely check the speed as 500 Mb, a script for complaining customers, I even told them this and within a minute they were quoting 800 Mb, for variety I suggested them pretend a higher figure than 500 Mb. I waited for a call back last night from India regarding testing the speeds (3 days average 370 Mb over 9 tests) but they must be busy delivering great service elsewhere. Vodafone are making Billions a year and want to grow and become the customer abusing monopoly serving their share holders and getting larger and more dominant in this field, Governments will need to be greased and influencers paid to achieve this goal. Like many Corporations that now seek to control and financially milk the consumer they care little for the people paying them quite decently for a service they don't provide and in the case of the latest con ""its in the terms and conditions"" they can increase our charges mid contract and take it or leave it, other large corporations are watching and learning. I would guarantee if their ""costs"" go down we won't be getting a reduction in our monthly bills. I will open another case with Modria and get a claim in against them, I am happy to pay for a speed they advertised but won't pay for anything less.

This is partly me; the bit that wasn't me was my conversation with the first agent on cancellation. I thought I had left Vodafone. I clarified this to the agent to confirm all costs for which I was liable. I confirmed with him that I would now be out and that there were no additional costs. Turns out they were to charge me another bill of £75.02. Quite steep, considering I had disconnected all the stuff 7 weeks ago, thinking I had cancelled.This left a bit of a sting.

Vodafone,5,GB,1,APPALLING,29-Jan-24,8d8f2622-d556-4b07-bb76-086de201449d,"I've been a Vodafone customer for more than 10 years and I wanted to get rid of them for the past 3. I had a business plan with several numbers on it. I have talked to their customer service numerous times, with different problems raised and ZERO results. More than that, they are set to turn problems raised into a sale and more often than not I ended up with an extra charge or an ""upgrade"" without my consent. Here's a list of my problems with them:- I purchased a device from them that I kept paying for 3 more years past the end of the agreement. By changing ownership of the plans they wrongly extended the contract for another 2 years and won't admit to it. They have no initial terms of contract, no details on the device but they are like a broken machine: ""We have done nothing wrong. You made a commitment. You have to pay""- I've had issues with the roaming services for years. Called dozens of times. Issue unresolved, but every time I called they tried to sell me something extra.- The one number connectivity for 3 smart watches is non-functional. Called multiple times, visited the store for technical support - issue unresolved, I was charged for it regardless.- Sales staff misleading and even fraudulent. I call for disconnection, they have marked a number for upgrade and locked me in a contract for another 2 years, despite letting them know of business closure and that one of the number would definitely not be of use anymore. This is blatant theft. - They don't send contractual terms, not do they write clearly what a contract is about: what phone number, what service. All is very vague, with complete lack of transparency.- The notes they released are edited, with minimal information. I can see I called asking for cancellation and the next rubric is filled with ""upgrade"", despite me not agreeing to it.Piece of advice: record your conversations with them, ask for the full name of the person you talk to, constantly check your charges and DO NOT TRUST ONE WORD THEY SAY # APPALLING",Negative,-0.007857143

I have wasted so much time speaking to lots of different Vodafone advisors who all say different things and none have helped resolve the issue. I have complained so many times and still nothing is fixed. I live in the city so can not understand why it is taking so long to fix. I am pregnant, self employed and need broadband to be able to work from home, I have explained about the stress this is causing me and still we are no further forward. Today I spoke to 3 different advisors via the Chat, one lied saying it would be fixed by 9.42am today it's still not working. I was then put through to 2 wrong departments who said oh they couldn't help. Absolute joke.

First engineer visited from city fibre but found the box on the pavement wasn’t next to my property and needed a neighbour’s permission to dig up their property. Neighbour refused. City fibre told me to liaise with Vodafone to rearrange the installation. Didn’t hear anything and so chased Vodafone up. I was told to wait for an update from city fibre. Didn’t hear anything again so chased up Vodafone. They told me that they couldn’t give me an installation date. I said I wanted to cancel the installation but they wouldn’t let me and said I’d have to wait for an update in 48 hours. Later that day I received another installation date. All good I thought! City fibre called me 2 days before the installation date to ask if I was ok with the installation going ahead. I said “yes but are you ok with it going ahead?” I asked if they knew the box needed moving. At first they said no then they said there was a note about moving it. I asked if it would be moved before the engineer visit, the agent said that was up to the engineer on the day. Again, all good I thought! Engineer turned up. I asked “do you know the Toby needs moving?” He said no and that he couldn’t move it!!! No full fibre installed.I submitted a complaint to Vodafone and have just found out that Vodafone sent out the second installation date without any communication with city fibre as to whether the box would be moved! Seems like I would have had a never ending cycle of engineers turning up, failed installations, me calling for a date, more installation dates being provided and more failed installations!Appalling service!

Vodafone,1,GB,1,Absolutely disgusting customer service,25-Jan-24,33ad425e-c21e-4694-99b1-880b52902e13,"Absolutely disgusting customer service. I applied for Broadband in the middle of last year. They strung me along until near December 2023 before cancelling the order because Cityfibre couldn't do the installation.I put in a new order right at the end of the year after confirming they were confident they could fulfill it that time. I got a call 2 days ago to tell me under no uncertain terms that the order had also been cancelled because Cityfibre had categorically informed them, they would NOT be installing Fibre to the building.Less than 24 hours later, yesterday, a team of Cityfibre Installation engineers show up and start installing Fibre in the building.Had a great chat with one of them today, nice bloke.Vodafone simply don't care. Now, they've done 2 hard searches on my credit report and I have absolutely nothing to show for the stress they've caused me and the sheer amount of time they have wasted. I confirmed I could put in another order today, so I do so online, and it failed at the credit check, which I find staggering because I don't have bad credit, and leads me to believe their system rejected me because of 2 previously cancelled orders.Their customer service have awful mic quality and are very difficult to understand, too. It's near impossible to get a telephone number from them as well, I only got one from a live agent via their broken ""TOBi"" chat application on their website.In conclusion, I don't recommend these guys at all.

Vodafone,30,GB,1,Incompetent useless charlatans,Updated 29 Jan 2024,0ab0ceda-cad6-45cf-981a-ea2be5dc09b8,"Once again.. vodafone is as incompetent as it gets. For no reason at all they cancelled my account. It seems that someone on their end caused this by mistake, but they refuse to take any action to rectify it immediately. I had to call 4 times to be told that my line is cancelled, as the first 3 customer support agents were just beating around the bush and telling me they see a migration request and that they 'raised requests' that would be looked into within 3-5 days. In the meantime I'm unable to work remotely and use my home internet, nor can I use mobile data as there is no reception where I live. I have no idea how I'm going to get my service back and judging from a past experience with them it will probably take over a month. In which time I will need to move flats as well, so I see far more issues with them in the future. Absolute useless and unreliable, please stay away from them. Avoid them at all costs.Update 29/01:It's been the 7th day that I'm left without broadband today. After being on the phone for 13.5 hours so far with Vodafone, they are still unable to fix my issue. Apparently the issue was caused because of a failed migration from copper to fiber - vodafone messed it up and when copper was stopped my line stopped working as well. I have been told that the issue would take 3-5 working days to be fixed. Then I've been told up to 72 hours. Then apparently the technical aspect was all ok and running but there was no billing information on my account so my line wouldn't operate. I tried multiple times to push for this billing information to be resolved ASAP as I need internet to do my job. It's like talking to a wall - 'sir it's going to take 5 working days'. I'm asking again and again for this to be expedited as it was caused by Vodafone's incompetence, but there is no response to that. Only the script that 'it's going to take 5 working days'. Multiple lies so far in the process (which Vodafone reps call it 'misinformation' but no, it's a lie). First, that the issue would be resolved in 72 hours. Then, that the issue would be resolved by the 29th of January (this has now moved to the 31st of January). For the bot that has replied here saying I need to contact social media, I did contact facebook messenger and didn't get a responce. I'm honestly just waiting to get a big compesation for it and then leave straight away, the absolute worst experience. Please avoid, avoid them like the plague. # Incompetent useless charlatans",Negative,-0.030865801

Vodafone,11,GB,2,Catalogue of incompetence,24-Jan-24,42980892-868f-4a6d-b74f-035800c066a2,"I was in a Vodafone shop for a phone issue and they persuaded me to sign up for their broadband service. I agreed in principle but told them I had to check the contract with my current provider for any penalties for leaving early. I discovered it would cost me £166 to leave so the next day told Vodafone I would wait. A week later my internet was cut off. I contacted my provider and they told me that I was no longer a customer and I was now with Vodafone, and of course they took the money. Vodafone couldn't explain what happened but offered me a free mobile wifi box to keep me going until my Vodafone broadband was set up in a week. A week came and went, no broadband. I went back to Vodafone who told me the order had been cancelled for some reason and it would be rescheduled for the following week and I could keep the mobile wifi, still free of charge, until I was connected the following week. A week later and the same story, no connection and the order had been cancelled again. Order was again rescheduled and once again I was told I could keep the mobile wifi free of charge until I was connected the following week. This time it actually happened and everything worked fine and I returned the mobile wifi box. Despite being told there would be no charge for this it did appear on my first bill. I also believe Vodafone are liable for the £166 it cost to get out of my original contract and I asked them to refund me this money. I was told the best they could do was a £50 refund.

Vodafone,2,GB,1,Shambles!,24-Jan-24,8ada19ca-1068-40fb-bd2e-bcc64d9b7a2b,"Where do I begin! An absolute shambles of a provider. After being with Vodafone on a 24 month contract for my phone and broadband which then moved onto a rolling contract, as I didn’t renew because they didn’t want to offer me any decent deals for me to stay. Had a price increase during this and at no point was I offered a better deal. I then received a message from the Vodafone which I initially thought was spam as it sounded as if I had agreed to a new contract without my knowledge. It was in fact for an upgrade to my broadband line from copper connection to fibre optic, but it made it sound as if I had asked for this to be done. After calling them, they said that it was just an intitiative to have lines upgraded by the government and that it was going to happen sooner or later. To which I then said that it was fine, but wasn’t told that it would tie me into another 24 contract at this point. Something which I hadn’t even asked for!!! I then called back after the installation of fibre optic, as I was having issues with the phone line when this was done by the engineer, and it was brought to my attention that I was put under a 24 month contract without my knowing. They then said that I was overpaying for my service and told me that I can save £10/month to stay on the same service to which I agreed. As soon as I got off the phone, I was sent a contract that stated it was £14/month more than what was agreed. I then decided that I had enough of Vodafone’s terrible communication and decided that I didn’t want to use Vodafone any longer. I was told that I had 30 days to find another provider. 5 days later I am sat here with no internet connection, as my new provider installs in another week. At nonoint was I told I would be disconnected from the service. In fact I was told that it would just switch over automatically. The communication at Vodafone is terrible. They try to lure you into contracts and when you decide to leave they make the process so difficult and leave you with no internet. Shocking service and never will I return to Vodafone again. They say thing and do another. Something needs to be done about these types of providers. They must be doing this to so many vulnerable people. I can’t stress enough how these guys need investigating for this poor communications and errors that they make. Seems small but causes the customer so much headache. I’m patient person but I am so angry with this provider.  I work from home and now left without internet for about a week!!! Absolutely no remorse shown either. Apparently I can start a new contract with them. It’s laughable. # Shambles!",Negative,-0.080252525

Vodafone,9,GB,1,"Honestly at this stage, I don't have a positive thing to say",23-Jan-24,4840fdb8-5e9e-4180-81e0-26f769be9c5f,"I had awful Internet connection over Christmas to the point I couldn't finish a single 40 minute TV show. I didn't want to deal with the stress over Christmas, so I waited until the 8th January when I couldn't use the Internet at all due to the speed being 2mbps. I spoke to someone who was nice and seemed like they wanted to help. We reset some things which gave me barely enough mbps to do my job, but it kept dropping out. They sent me out a new booster and called me back the next day. On this day we set up the new booster, I commented on how my speeds were better but still dropping out. They wanted to do a speed test using a lan device which I didn't have so we arranged the next day to call again.So day 3. They used a programme to see through my phone, to make sure I was giving them the correct information. Showed a laptop on lan, getting about 15mbps. I pay for 900mbps. The person on the other end kept saying how she wanted to recheck my line from her side 3 times, to make sure she was getting an accurate number, and she confirmed the speed going into my house was roughly 15mbps... But it was fluctuating. So she said citi fibre would need to come out. I booked three slots and was told they could come out any of these times, but she'd ask them to can me first. The appointment times were 8am to 6pm on the 16th and 2pm to 6pm on the 17th So from 8am on the 16th Jan I was stuck to my phone. I work from home and everytime I thought I had a car or van, I went to check. No one came to the house, and no one called. I think these companies forget that I can literally screenshot my call list to show that no one rang me.So I took the weekend off from this stress and today raised a complaint, as I didn't want to have to go through the same 3 day process as before. I receive a text message saying I would get a call between 4 and 6pm tonight.The person who rang me might have been a complaint manager but it was hard to keep track as they spoke so quickly. I'd ask a question about why citi fibre didn't come out to the appointment and get a 3 minute response to say they did come out and checked the line and they did call me. Again, I can screenshot my call list and show the only call I received was after 6pm, and I answered it.They wanted to know how much compensation I wanted and I kept trying to explain I wanted the % of days since I first reported the issue on the 8th. I then got a lecture (I received this lecture about 6 times, I kid you not) that I had only reported an issue in October that was put as resolved and the report on the 8th Jan which had been marked as resolved because I didn't answer my phone when contacted. At some point I asked them to please stop shouting at me and of course they said they weren't shouting at me and calls were recorded, however as soon as I asked them to stop shouting, they then stopped shouting. A ticket was raised about someone coming out but they didn't explain exactly what was happening. Finally managed to get them to tell me at the end that someone will contact you within the next 24-48 hours and book a time for a technician to come out again (surely if they did in fact come out last time, they wouldn't be doing this again as there is no fault?). Then they went on another lecture about how Vodafone gave me the £17.03 I asked for because they're not about making money but caring about people. If that were true they wouldn't have shouted at me and kept telling me that I was at fault because I didn't answer my phone that never rang. So there is no time frame for when they're going to call me. So they could call when I'm driving and if I don't answer they'll close the ticket as resolved. I'll have to take my phone to the bathroom then and they can hear me using the loo or in the middle of a shower.. Honestly why can't they give me the working hours so I'd know when to accept the call?There were technical issues throughout this call. I was put back on hold by accident. The call ""disconnected"" and they had to ring me back. I received a text message stating they'd call me today between 4 and 6 pm, but the multi text messages they sent me with the reference number did not come through, but of course this wasn't there issue. It was clearly issues with my phones connection (which I don't have currently). Why is it that these companies refuse to take any responsibility. I did not answer the phone when called (there was no call). The time I called was put as resolved yet I'm still reporting an issue. They couldn't agree to compensation unless I calculated the exact amount I pay per day, because that would have been too difficult for them to do? Their text service is fine so it's my phones connection that's the issue, without asking me if there was one. They also kept stating that everytime they checked my line it was fine, but I know this is not the case. Since every call is recorded maybe they can listen back instead of calling me a liar? # Honestly at this stage, I don't have a positive thing to say",Positive,0.095991254

Initially, the service was commendable; Moe was courteous and efficient. However, my experience took an unfortunate turn due to the behavior of the assistant store manager, Khai. His approach was unexpectedly abrupt and dismissive, culminating in him removing the phone without explanation and making a disparaging remark. While I am aware of and respect release date policies, the manner in which it was enforced was neither professional nor respectful. Customer service is paramount, and it’s crucial for all staff, particularly management, to uphold high standards of customer care.

Having to call them every single month to rectify something on my bill. Being autistic I use the web chat service as phone calls are extremely hard for me, once the staff know that they talk to me like I’m stupid and make really ableist remarks. I’ve never been on the web chat for less than 30 minutes and that’s not including any waiting time usually it’s a few hours!! they also seem hell bent on asking if your details are upto date and if you say ‘all my details are upto date’ they don’t believe you and waste more time confirming details for no reason. Today I was on the webchat for over an hour nearly 2 because I couldn’t get signal on my phone, after speaking to 2 advisors (who made me do the same things) one of which insisted I changed my settings to something that would impact my battery (and when I refused lied to me saying that it wouldn’t even though my phone was even telling me so) a manager appeared and fixed the problem in 5 minutes.I had a direct debit set up briefly but after being sent a text saying ‘I need to pay my bill now or they will cut me off’ so I went on the webchat just to be told I had to pay the bill even though there was a direct debit in place. I paid it and then a few days later the direct debit came out! When I tried to get my money back they said they would discount it from my next bill!?! Then I had to threaten to take it further while they lied to me saying they don’t have the ability to do refunds. I did eventually get my money back, eventually!They also message you about paying your bill before the bills even due and now due to them changing their contracts into 2 bills instead of 1. if you pay the device bill early then it’s classed as a contribution not a bill payment so you need to pay twice or they threaten to cut you off! And no they won’t refund or let you move anything around. They constantly assure you that your problems with them won’t be repeated whilst simultaneously constantly repeating the problems.There’s more and more and moreAll the staff are either not getting the correct training or just do not care about helping you fix problems and don’t have any care for inclusivity for those with disabilities.

Every time we're given a repair date it gets pushed back. Now we have no idea when the service will be restored. In the meantime, we have to rely on the 4G dongle you provided. As the 4G Vodafone network in our area is poor, and the dongle keeps running out of data, this isn't an acceptable solution. My partner and I both work from home, which has been almost impossible since the problem started, meaning that we've both had to take annual leave.Apart from eventually being told that the fault is with the Openreach network, we have had almost no communication from you concerning the nature of the fault and why it's taking so long to fix.

Vodafone,19,GB,1,After leaving Vodafone during the…,Updated 22 Jan 2024,e259dada-311a-439f-9e05-d65cc05774f5,"After leaving Vodafone during the cooling off time, I was sent a text for 14 pounds. I spent a considerable amount of time on phone other day, but it seems there isn't any way I can get the money to them, so looks like I will be running up charges through no fault of my own. I tried to transfer it via my bank, but as my account is closed, it didn't recognise my account so bank said it couldn't send my money. I tried paying Vodafone on their own line thing, same thing happened. Phoned customer care, automated line won't accept it either, so I was told I have to pay by cheque ( I have no cheque book, neither does anyone I know) or pay it at the local shop. The problem there being I am disabled with no car and getting to town is expensive and not simple. Plus it has to be said I think it unlikely that the people at the shop would accept the payment either .Has I am struggling with an auto immune disease which is made worse with stress, as well as a myriad of other health issues including remission from cancer, and also that phone companies have made my life a total misery since moving house, I am a loss as to what to do about paying Vodafone a precious 14 pounds which is obviously easily more important than my health.And it's no good them telling me to contact their social media team as I'm not on social media and do not understand tech.UpdateRe answer from Vodafone from my review before. I have rung the customer service and it's difficult because everything is saying they don't recognise my number as having an account with Vodafone. Which is strange because how then did they manage to text my number asking for 14 pounds?? I don't even know what the 14 pounds is for, as I left during the 14 day cooling off period. Still the agent wanted a pin that I do not have. I told her my situation and all the cruelty and time wasting I've had from mobile phone companies since I moved house, and the answer to my review on trust pilot. Then she got angry and shouted at me that she couldn't take my money without the pin and I'd have to pay it at the shop.I have already explained the difficulty and expense if have getting to the shop.I have now placed this matter with age UK who will be ringing you early next week. I am also in the process of sending information on how ridiculous this has unfolded, and unreasonable treatment of a vulnerable person by three major providers to my local MP, who particularly dislikes this kind of practice by big companies and their staff.I've tried several times to pay this money and I haven't been able to, I don't even know what it's for. So now I suppose you will add on hundreds of pounds in charges and send me threatening messages.21st century UK.

I had the Z fold 3 which is in warranty and their external company that repair are trying to charge £600+ for the screen splitting which is after researching is a common theme and telling me its not protected as its screen issue and because of scratches from my keys on the frame which is purely cosmetic and impact damage which wasn't there when I handed the phone over to the Vodafone employee to send off. How can you say you'll not cover it under warranty because of those reasons but you'll repair the screen which is covered by the warranty for £600 🤔 I also am 16 days into a new contract with the S23 Ultra as I thought Vodafone were decent which I'm regretting now. My broadband contract with Vodafone is ending in August and will definitely not be renewing. So disappointing after so many years. Total care warranty is a joke. Even worse you've asked me on your Facebook page to message and it's hours of waiting to get through security questions. Absolutely disgusting customer service.

I talked to Adele today and she wasn’t really helping either only said either I pay full amount or wait for the debt collectors to contact me.

Before also someone was meant to contact me and they didn’t and when I talked to debt collectors they told me that the account is with Vodafone. It’s a big mess!

It also could have a serious impact to our feelings and judgment. I deal with a few people in the Vodaphone shop Alex, Robert and Jay.They are lovely people. They did their best to sort out my mobile problem. Later I found out I couldn't use my mobile services because of completely different reason.There is an online company Vodaphone call them sister, name is Talkmobile.Communication with them is on mobile. They are nice people too. They do their best to help customer. I should admit the fact it's not easy to deal with my kind of people with poor knowledge about technology.

I'm a systems and networks engineer by trade and despite happily being given the PPPoE Username and Password, I kept getting rejected by their system when trying to establish a connection. I'm fully aware of the VLAN's for different network providers and played about with a few settings as well as trying different combinations due to other user experiences however still did not work. Called Vodaphone a total of 4 times to try and get it resolved and they only help they were prepared to give is to provide the Username and Password.In the end I decided to cancel within 24 hours as the Customer Service was abysmal! I did try using the router purely as a modem for my existing equipment (against my preference as I'd prefer to have just one device) but the UI for the router is so unbelievably un-user friendly it is ridiculous. For example there is limited functionality and when you try and change the LAN IP settings, you go to enter an IP address and after the 1st Octet it automatically skips to the 3rd completely missing out the 2nd so after each octet you have to use the mouse to go to the next one. This is such a basic function that it should go from one to the next without skipping but clearly the firmware is lacking in common sense.So as I said previously after no help from 1st line support and their refusal from 2nd line support to investigate, I have decided to cancel the service within 24 hours as it tells me all I need to know about Vodaphone's Broadband as a provider. # BROADBAND - STAY AWAY IF YOU HAVE A 3RD PARTY ROUTER!!!",Positive,0.033385093

Vodafone,2,GB,1,Don't use Vodafone,19-Jan-24,d549616a-b937-45c2-9135-aea4c60dd9b9,Don't use Vodafone I was mis sold a new contract two years ago by a lady in the Birkenhead shop who told me that she was new to the job and only been there 4 weeks. I asked for a similar package to the one I had which was for 24 months. What she didn't explain was that I would be paying an extra £6 per month for 36 months to purchase the phone This was on top of my billing for texts etc. Now my two years is up I wanted to renew my phone as the one which she advised me to get was useless. But I was stuck in a 24 month contract. Phoning Vodafone is an experience. Kept putting me on hold to get advice about the extra £6 per month for 36 months. He was so unhelpful and in the end I've had to pay £96 up front to purchase the useless phone and to get out of the contract. I told him that I couldn't afford it and would have to cut back on my outgoings to cover the cost. He didn't care. I'm 79 years old but not stupid. The lady in the Vodafone shop should have had more training as should the chat and phone services for Vodafone which were useless. I'm so stressed by this incident. I've been with Vodafone for a great many years and would never use them again They are heartless. Unfortunately I didn't read the small print but took the lady's word for the contract.

So when I called up today to explain the situation the representative tells me I failed one of the security questions because I couldn't access my new phone number, which I told them I have the sim which was left in the parcel bag but no phone to plug it into, so unable to access the number/sim. What a joke and now I have to wait to find out the verdict of the investigation which was launched by Carphone Warehouse who I purchased the phone from and DPD who delivered it to the wrong address.

So phoned them went through all this and have now gone back to original deal, so i am now leavinf vodafone.  Is this how a customer of 30 years should be treated (i know shoild have left years ago, but always got a good deal) but because of this i am saving my self even more money! # Tried upgrading sim",Positive,0.18466811

Another issue was for 2 days loss of internet service, Vodafone credited me with a laughable amount of £2.89. And the compensation amount for the 2 hour call, zero! I'll be shopping now for a company that has better technical expertise (don't overcharge) and practice better moral standards. # Vodafone's policies suck!!",Positive,0.07

Vodafone,1,GB,1,Stay away from this company,19-Jan-24,e4836df2-bded-4b34-b735-2119dec8bd43,I had a phone contract with devise with Vodafone back in 2020 and when the device cost was paid they continue to take the money and tell you this is your responsibility to call when the device has finished being paid for. So I called to cancel and I was told you need a pac code. I feel I made it more than clear I want the contract cancelled and I cancelled my direct debit. to then receive a bill with no other contact to say they will pass this onto a dept collection agent for £72.10 So again I called and I was told they are sorry but they did not cancel the contract and said this would now take 24 hours to cancel and I will need to call back to process the credit. I call back again and have to go through the process again and get passed from one agent to the next this has now taken hours. My experience is Vodaphone are bullies who will keep taking you money even when the cost of the device has been paid. They have no intension of sorting out the issue and expect people to be experts on what pac numbers are. This is simple I want to cancel why does a pac number being given to another provide have to be the way to cancel. At the point of calling I'm out of contract. Do as I ask and cancel the sim simple. Just to recap Vodaphone will charge you for something you have already paid for. # Stay away from this company,Positive,0.023863636

Vodafone,57,GB,1,They make cancellation as hard as possible,19-Jan-24,7283d582-c623-4bc7-9e2f-ef97b76e1416,They make cancellation and understanding what you need to do as difficult as possible. Apparently 30days before the end of your broadband contract you must inform them you’re leaving- I checked online and it is not stated anywhere. I also was not given notice of the end of my 2yr contract (just remembered to check myself). Informed them via web chat that I was leaving to be sure a few weeks before the end of my contract and to be sure contacted them on my final day to confirm. I have now been told that doesn’t count as having informed them and I will pay a cancellation fee. Customer service refused to discuss my complaint and put the phone down on me!!

Vodafone,11,GB,3,A disappointing start,19-Jan-24,ed704ee6-f1ea-43ff-afb3-ec89361e8e21,"Review for broadband set up. Switched from BT, only because of cost. Set up was great and can’t fault CityFibre at all, respectful, quick, clean installation and the supply is all good, I have no disappointment with regards to any of this. However when taking out the contract online I was informed that I do not need to do anything with regards to cancellation of my current provider, BT, and that Vodafone will inform them directly. After all was set up I contacted BT to inform them I would be cancelling my DD payments and was told they they were not informed. After a lengthy call to Vodafone I now have to take myself to one of their shop once I have proof of last payment to BT and the email showing where it says I didn’t need to do anything (this of course being an automatically generated email and likely to be what they send out all the time) and once showing them this they will refund me what I have paid to BT due to Vodafone not cancelling on my behalf. Being self employed and working six days a week I probably won’t have time to do this so I’m very disappointed by this situation. Such a shame for a simple task that I was informed they would do, which I could have as easily done had they just said to call BT and cancel I’m now going to be out of pocket…..

Vodafone,1,GB,1,Would never recommend,19-Jan-24,864903c9-6ded-4ce7-a7d4-6fea96d067c2,"Vodafone switched me to fibre broadband 8 days ago. There was an issue with the external connection therefore I was informed that my copper broadband would remain active until the fibre broadband was fixed. I was assured the fibre would be working within 48 hours. The copper broadband connection was turned off after 48 hours however the fibre broadband still was not working, leaving me without a broadband connection. I spoke to Vodafone again and they assured me they had now fixed the issue and it would be working within 24 hours. 24 hours later I still didn’t have broadband connection, I spoke to somebody else via a raised complaint, they followed up by email to say that it would be fixed with it 24-48 hours. After that time it still was not working. I phoned the fault line with the fault reference number I had been sent on email and it did not recognise the fault number. I eventually spoke to somebody, who passed me on to somebody else, who directed me through a hard reset. They said it would be up and running within max 1 hour but more likely 10 mins. No surprises, it’s still not working. When trying to arrange an engineer, the guy on the phone said there was a fault in the appointment booking system and he would have to do it manually. So I still have no broadband connection and by the time the engineer comes back out it will have been 10 days without an internet connection.The ‘compensation’ offered is pitiful.

Vodafone,6,GB,2,CHANGING CONTRACT,17-Jan-24,c2ab532c-542c-4dab-95be-b9a5dfa82a3d,"I visited the Vodafone Shop in Merry Hill as my current contract had expired in October 2023. I wanted to get a cheaper deal as I had not been using all the allowances. The assistant was really helpful in finding a cheaper contract with Talkmobile at £12.95 per month (reduced from £28.50).A couple of hours later someone from Vodafone called (as I had requested a PAC) to talk about a Vodafone retention deal for £8 per month but, as I had already switched, she could not actually offer me that deal. I expressed my disappointment that could not have been offered in the shop earlier. She said that the deal would not have been available to the shop assistant at that time. I said that I was not very impressed that the customer service was not very ""joined up"" across all of the Vodafone teams and that I felt very let down having thought I had got the best deal possible only to discover that a better deal could have been on the table for me. Obviously, I accept that neither the sales assistant or the retention team person were individually at fault here and no deception was meant BUT I do feel very disappointed that a Vodafone Shop did not have all the right available deals for me to choose from at the initial point of contact and sale!Not brilliant customer service in my opinion. # CHANGING CONTRACT",Positive,0.075933788

I have been unable to access the data I am paying for for over 6 months. Despite being promised callbacks from managers and compensation, nothing has ever been done. Tomorrow, my contract ends. Today, it took me over an hour and 5 different people from various departments just to confirm that the contract would not be automatically renewed and no further payments would be made. I had to pretend I was a new customer just to speak to someone who I could understand. The first few members of the foreign call center were extremely rude, difficult to understand, and showed no understanding of contracts and expectations. I have been assured that a manager will call me back to discuss compensating me for paying nearly £60 a month for the past 6+ months with no internet. However, I was informed that if I miss the call, they will not try again or notify me by email. So, if I am at work and cannot answer, it will be seen as my fault and they will think I am uninterested in continuing to address the issue. If I am not constantly available by the phone for the next 48 hours, chances are slim that this problem will be resolved. The level of incompetence and disrespect is astounding. # 6+ months. No data.

I had cancelled my phone with Vodafone as a contract and went elsewhere. Now, I was not informed that once my old number was disconnected, any additional payment would be needed, as for reasons, I haven't used this contact number since July/August. I had then gone to chat with a member of staff on Sunday and explained my frustration with this, to be told that I would have to pay it and would be refunded the amount after the disconnection date. Seem fair ? absolutely not. Why am I paying for something that hasn't been used, and was not informed this additional payment would need to be paid ? My email after the original complaint was dealt with DID NOT state that any further payments would be made so why am I being told I have to pay for a device to then receive £30 less than payment when the phone hasn't been used in months? The people at the customer service team clearly do not understand my frustration and for a manager to ""review"" my chat takes connection and can take a further 20 minutes? Where's the manager, and why is it taking 20 minutes to connect to someone to look over a complaint. Also, why does Vodafone not have a complaints procedure ?

Vodafone,1,GB,1,I hate Vodafone so much,16-Jan-24,9c0f98ea-e505-4790-a210-145992a4ae6f,"I hate Vodafone so much, please do not ever join this horrific company. They are sly money pinching. I have had my network not work for up to a month several times over the past year - Vodafone never ever let me know there would be disruptions - I had to call in every time and they would say oh theirs issues and the engineers are working on it, it’s due to end this date xxxxxx please call back then to get a refund applied. It wasn’t until the most recent call in November an agent told me they would sign me up for automatic service updates. I then called for the refund I was due to receive in November, in jan, as getting through to them is a nightmare. They made me wait 20 minutes on hold to say there’s currently service issues they are working on which won’t be completed until March (I’m leaving them in feb) and “as per their policy” they can’t refund me until the work has been completed as it wouldn’t be fair to me. So just to clarify their policy is you can only ask for a refund after they have completed the work, so you are compensated in full but it’s your duty to call once the work has been completed - which they most likely will not notify you for. If you don’t call you’re not automatically refunded, unless you bring it to their attention despite them not proving the service you are paying for. When you do call back to have this applied, despite several agents stating they have left notes on your account, you spend up to an hour of your time describing the situation and being passed from department to department explaining why you’re due the refund for them to tell you to CALL BACK WHEN YOUR BILL IS DUE to take it off then. I absolutely detest this network, everyone I know on the network detests it also. Their policies and customer service is despicable, and that’s why they’re cheaper than EE (who btw i never ever had issues with). Please if you take any advice ever, let it be to avoid this network like the plague. They do not deserve to be providing services as I’m sure many people are getting scammed. I’m going to see who I can speak to about having this investigated legally/financially/formally on a large scale. # I hate Vodafone so much",Positive,0.018367347

Vodafone,6,GB,1,My experience with the Vodafone.,16-Jan-24,51bfb21c-c0d9-404a-b4f9-efa9d54e0871,My experience with the Vodafone.After one year use by the monthly pay I sighted contract by the conversation with Vodafone operator (info line). After 2 or 3 h. Problem was with transfer of the phone number. But not to bad - number was transfer and contract signet. First bill - about £17. Strange because contract was on £10. But ok - first bill. Second bill £20. My first contact by the phone - three operators and 3h lost during conversation. Nobody know about £17. But one lady told me information. You have not direct debit and will fee £5. ME????????? DURING SIGNHT CONTRACT NOBODY TOLD ME ABOUT IT. ONE YEAR I PAID AND INFORMATION ABOUT ACCOUNT WAS IN SYSTEM.Next day again called to me Vodafone and try explained me information £20 bill but I ask about £17 paid first time ?????????Ok Vodafone operator told me .... ok we give you £20 refund of this £17. Me: Ok it is fine form me. Next bill £10 + £ 5 fee no direct debit. ???I call again why £5 Fee ??? finally they has my account detail but was not activated this direct debit. But £5 gone. I called again why £5 fee because it is on bill from last month and was refund in this £20. £20 refund of the £17 not £5??? Finally this £5 was not refund - it is lost. I lost on the conversation about 6-7h (all).I waiting to finish my contract with the Vodafone. Maybe problem is with the people of the info line but people make the company. My recondition - hmmm If you have good relation with your company and you are happy NEVER CHANGE ON VODAFONE. Suspect if you pay only bills - Vodafone is ok.

The way they treat their customers is so poor. Causing so much inconvenience and wasting so much time. I have been on a customer support chat for 2h 15 min. For something as basic as wifi coverage which Vodafone can't provide to their customers. So ridiculous. Also Shubham, Mohit and Anushree have provided disgusting and rude customer service, completely useless. They kept repeating the same things and did not solved the issue. Do not buy any plans with Vodafone. They have become too big to appreciate their customers business apparently. There are other broadband providers out there they still respect their customers paying the bills to the business. If any issues with Vodafone broadband the customer service is very inefficient via Tobi chat as well as being passed from one department to the other and wasting so much time on the chat box. Rather than efficiently solving the issues in a timely fashion. Also, there are unique instances like mine where there is a need for a tech expert to physically come and have a look at the issue rather than me chatting for hours with very poor quality Vodafone employees that do not have the basis to understand the problems. It's frustrating and upsetting at the same time, but again if Vodafone doesn't need/ appreciate me as a customer, I don't need them either as provider. # Vodafone Broadband - Extremely poor",Negative,-0.171933333

Fine when you're buying. Awful at creating & resolving issues. Never again.Vodafone's replies have been typically more corporate platitudes and bland spaghetti word salads that mean nothing in the real world - if they acted or actually understood or were congruent with their messages I would still be a customer and had days of my life restored.Update - having wasted two hour and Vodafone confirming in writing (I have copies) that this insane 1p bill will be sorted I am still being pursued for the ""oustanding bill"" of 1p.Before you sign-up with their amazing sales team read their canned bot customer service answers here - all platitudes and meaningless corporate-speak - no care no action.PS my partner was on a Vodafone sim only cancelled end of contract because of the price then was offered a deal half the cost with twice the data - where from Vodafone!!!

Vodafone,6,GB,1,Truly shocking & terrible service from Vodafone,14-Jan-24,66fce87a-090f-4968-b789-1c2492a08573,"Called Vodafone to upgrade iPhone & iPad which was overdue. Was told that my order will be delivered on Tuesday next week and that I will receive a PIN code to my email address as DPD won’t release my order without it. All seems fine I thought until DPD try to deliver the to me the next day but I haven’t received a PIN to my phone number or email address. Turns out that for some reason known only to Vodafone, they have given DPD a long since cancelled phone number that I once had with them many years ago rather than my main contact number that I’ve had with them now for years, the one that they call me & text me on fairly frequently? Common sense seems to be completely lost here. Then I reach out to them on X / twitter, they ask me to explain the problem (I’ve already done this on the phone to customer services). Which I do again, I tell them the details of my issue on X. They then have the absolute stupidity to say to me “we’re sorry that you feel like this” (yes my friend, I feel like this because I’ve already taken time to explain my complaint to you and you’re now asking me to write to you to explain the whole thing again) ask me to contact them via email / facebook messenger to explain my complaint all over again.  I mean, this company has absolutely no self awareness whatsoever.

Vodafone,7,GB,1,Vodafone broadband,Updated 14 Jan 2024,27b3620e-78b1-4a5d-a5b8-51a0669eef1c,"Hello,I wanted to share my experience with anyone considering joining Vodafone's full fiber network. I've been a customer for several years and was generally satisfied with the WiFi connection I had until I decided to upgrade to full fiber in August 2022. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a big mistake and a major disappointment.Initially, my contract was £24.00 a month for a maximum 67mb connection, which worked fine. However, in August 2022, Vodafone offered me full fiber 900mb for £30.00 a month, which seemed like a great deal for the increased speed and reasonable price. However, after the upgrade, I started experiencing frequent connectivity issues.I've contacted Vodafone customer services multiple times in an attempt to resolve these issues, but unfortunately, they have been unable to fix the problem. They have sent me three boosters, but these have provided no improvement whatsoever.As someone who works from home, this situation has greatly affected my work. I'm unable to maintain a stable connection during video meetings on platforms like WhatsApp and Skype, and even my TV connection keeps cutting off.Even after speaking with a Vodafone broadband expert in January 2024 who assured me that the issue would be resolved, nothing has changed. This has been a shocking and frustrating experience. I will never choose or recommend Vodafone to anyone else. I would like to cancel my account at the earliest possible please.Following my complaint, Vodafone reached out to discuss the issue. However, despite the clear evidence that the problem lies with their network, they are still insisting on charging a cancellation fee. This is completely unreasonable. # Vodafone broadband",Negative,-0.007118056

I had confirmed the contract over the phone and all I had to do was collect the phone and the shop said no as I didn’t have the debit card on me that matched the account 🤣.

I have been misled and manipulated. I am happy to have checked now but now I don't want to keep these 2 years contracts.I need to check if I can end that contract because I don't want to use Vodafone anymore.Check before you get a contract with them, they charge many things outside the contract and if you need to pay to go abroad, Vodafone is definitively not  a company to use, most of the others don't charge a daily fee.I hope my mistake will save the hassle to other customers.

Vodafone,4,GB,1,Don't buy phones and plans from Vodafone!,Updated 12 Jan 2024,318ae47a-61a7-4b02-ab90-b4f4b93a5d3b,"I bought a phone from them over Black Friday, built my data plan on my phone, gave my old phone for trade in. In no part of the buying process I was informed or consented that they would give me a new card and new number, not put the plan on my actually existing number. Again, during no point of this purchase I was informed that I would have to use a new number, and that they wouldn't cancel the payments for the other line so my old number would cost me another £32 monthly (I was out of plan and which is why I wanted to drop it and have a new plan), on top of the new sim £16 + the actual phone cost. So now, I am paying £48 alone on only the data, another £26 for the device, why the hell am I paying £74 to you, and this is my discounted price after I traded in my old phone?! Why wouldn't you inform me that you wouldn't simply put the new plan on my existing number? Or inform me that I would be charged for both lines? Why would you give me a new number that I didn't ask for and paid for the past 2 months? Why would your customer assistants inform me that this would change this month and I wouldn't be charged and there would be a refund on my account for the December but I am still informed that I need to pay £74? I went to Vodafone shop in Shepherds Bush to ask about the extra SIM card Vodafone has sent me and they checked my account and said Vodafone just sends them away to make sure customers have micro sims available for their new devices, nothing to worry about and everything’s fine. No mention of 2 different numbers, accounts, nothing. I wonder for how many of your customers you're pulling this stuff, how many people pay you for stuff they didn't ask for and aren't aware of! I should have been paying £16 for my new plan on my EXISTING number, and £26 for my device, so £42 a month, not the £74 I have been paying for the past 2 months! You are taking my phone for trade in for £5 a month, instead charge me £32 more!!!!!!!! Why would I want to change my number when I’m trying to add a new airtime plan to my number, while I already have an existing number with you for over 5 years? What makes you think we should add a new number for them, instead of actually putting an airtime plan to the existing phone number? Throughout the process on Vodafone app, in nowhere, not while I was picking for a phone, nor when I was picking an airtime plan, I was asked if I was aware that the new Airtime plan would be on a NEW NUMBER. I was not made aware. When I went to your shop, I was told not to worry, it was my own number and just a spare card, when I called your customer service, I was told they were sorry and they would fix it. This is disgusting. I should've just gone to Apple instead of being scammed for £32 every month by you! Disgusting. I have just talked on Facebook customer care and was informed I have to cancel my service? I wasn’t informed about anything. Your employee SACHIN was not helpful at all, told me because I signed it, I was responsible. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE WHEN YOU DECIDE TO PUT THE AIRTIME PLAN ON A NEW NUMBER WHEN AN EXISTING CUSTOMER WITH AN EXISTING NUMBER MAKES A PURCHASE. It makes absolutely zero sense that you would give your customers a new number without warning them about it multiple times with big fonts that the airtime is not going to be on their EXISTING NUMBER. THAT YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP CHARGING BE THEM ON THE EXISTING NUMBER, ON TOP OF THE NEW NUMBER. I will be making legal complaints to Trading standards and I’m already in contact with citizens advice over this. You’re scamming people. # Don't buy phones and plans from Vodafone!",Positive,0.101114082

Vodafone,7,GB,1,Absolutely shocking from start to finish,Updated 13 Jan 2024,f380a9d8-3b35-4dec-9bbd-df96883dd798,"We had vodafone broadband at our previous address, and we had a nightmare experience. We had issues at setup, then during the contract as well. On one occasion I spent over 5 hours on an online chat trying to resolve errors and raise a complaint.As icing on the cake, six months down the line (after a headache cancelling the plan) I've discovered that they've marked our account as overdue in error (it's closed!), which has tanked my credit rating when I'm looking to get a mortgage. I will now have to waste another day of my time trying to get hold of them to sort this out.Update: Lovely template reply shows that my review clearly wasn't actually read by Vodafone. Spent over an hour on the phone to them yesterday (mostly on hold), trying to get them to raise a formal complaint for me; something they are extremely reluctant to actually do! Now I've been told someone will contact me next Friday. Sadly, this is exactly what I've come to expect from this company. # Absolutely shocking from start to finish",Negative,-0.072067901

Vodafone,7,GB,1,Their staff are just useless,11-Jan-24,97b82606-8c12-4228-9b0d-02ba82d7445e,"I’m a business customer with a few mobile lines in Nuneaton have been with Vodafone for a just over a year. We moved from EE as they were so expensive, and although Vodafone are cheaper, their coverage is poor. We are based in CV10 and quite often we get a 3G or E bar and neither load the internet.I need to get an iPhone 15 pro max for my business so I was going to upgrade early with Vodafone and pay an extra £270 to do the early upgrade, but when I thought about it, I really didn’t want to be tied to them for another two years with bad signal.On Monday the 8th Jan I called to speak to them  about it. The call handler said she’d pass it to the tech team who would call me back in 10 mins, I didn’t receive any call backs.On Tuesday 9th Jan I called and re explained my issue. This man was a-bit more helpful and said he understood my issue and would look to see how we could improve signal and he also offered to turn on my 5G. I questioned why it hadn’t been connected before, but then he checked and said there is no 5G in or around Nuneaton. He also admitted once 3G is turn off I really would have issues so said he’d investigate and call me back at 5pm.I was at work and my phone was on silence be he called me back at 1pm, 2.30pm and 4pm. He left voicemails each time to confirm the signal won’t improve and I can cancel with no exit fee. He didn’t call me at 5pm though unfortunately so I called back on Wednesday the 9th to cancel the contract.This is where the issues really began. The person on the 9th hadn’t left any notes on my account and absolutely no one else can do anything or use any common sence (and apparently they can’t speak to the person I spoke to on the 9th to confirm anything).I was on the phone for an hour and a half on the 10th to a woman. Initially she was looking into it, then she couldn’t as she had no authority to do anything anyway, then she was passing it to the tech team, then to a manager to request them to listen to the call between myself and the person on the 9th.I explained there was no point listening to that call, they need to listen to the calls he made to my voicemail, but she couldn’t comprehend that they would have those calls recorded too and she kept saying for data protection they wouldn’t be able to access those (they’re outgoing calls, what difference does it make if I’ve answered the phone or he’s left me a voicemail)?I offered to save the recoding and email them over but she wouldn’t allow that either. The manager refused to speak to me and I ended up loosing my ***.Today, Thursday the 11th, Vodafone just called (fantastic)! The person on the phone said “I’m calling to see if your issue has been resolved”? I asked if he’d resolved it and he said he hadn’t even read the notes and didn’t even know what my issue was…so that was another 15 min call completely wasting my time. He couldn’t even explain why he was calling me. After doing a little bit of research he said “a manager is listening to the call and will get back to you in 24hrs”…which is what I already knew..so why was he calling? If the call centre was 4500 miles closer I’d have gone there and banged on the door until they dealt with my issue. I’m so annoyed! I always expect business customers to have a slightly better experience than the public, so I dread to think how they treat the public.I’m still no further forward. I’ve explained to them on every single call that I NEED a new IPhone 15 by Saturday as we’re using it for promo work for my business so I need them to let me leave the contract based on poor signal.The woman yesterday said they’ve had loads of mast issues and also said that if I had proof someone told me I could cancel I can, yet they won’t listen to my voicemails.If there were no signal issues I’d have simply upgraded. # Their staff are just useless",Negative,-0.037874516

Vodafone,8,GB,1,TERRIBLE SERVICE!,11-Jan-24,13116ac8-5d15-4e43-8f41-d1bc9a8977bf,"January 2023 I received an email from Vodaphone advising that they would be upgrading my line to fibre, free of charge. After months of City Fibre turning up and trying to install the line, they are not able to attach a line to a chimney, there was no other fixing point on that would allow line to be at the minimum required height across my neighbours garden/and or the road outside. After all this hassle, I instructed them to cancel the Fibre upgrade and leave me alone. October, my contract came to an end. I placed an order with BT to take over my line. Vodaphone text me acknowledgement on 14th November confirming my line would be taken over and I would be disconnected from 13th December. On the 17th November I received a text message advising that they were going to UPGRADE ME on 6th December!!!! Trying to cancel this upgrade was a bloody nightmare. Automated text messages etc DID NOT WORK. ONLY after I tried twice, was my messaged passed to a HUMAN, and on 22nd November they acknowledged that I was NOT upgrading to full fibre with City Fibre and have cancelled that order. On the 13th December BT did not take over the line (they needed a cherry picker to reach the chimney) and recommended I contact Vodaphone to ask they do not terminate my service until take over complete (I'm a home worker). I called Vodaphone and was advised it was TOO late. They start the process, within the 48hrs in the lead up, and as a result my service would be terminated that day. FINE! Anything to be rid of Vodaphone! I decided to buy a bolt on, for extra data on my phone to hot/spot work from home. SURPRISE SURPRISE, my internet was still working the following week! So I called Vodaphone who advised because BT hadn't taken the line over yet, it was still working, and I would need to pay that months bill. Paid it. BT Installed my line 2nd January! Horay! Bill received from VODAPHONE! LINE NOT CANCELLED! They tried to tell me, because BT didn't take the line on the 13th December, I HAD TO DO A MANUAL CANCELLATION! AND REPLACE THE TERMINATION ORDER! And I would have to pay charges for the line up to today! 11th January! I am fuming! Customer service is shocking. No one is listening, and only after 1hr30 mins, going round and round in circles, the only thing I THINK has happened, is the line has been cancelled. I'm being told billing cannot sort the issues until the termination is complete, which takes 2 working days. SO are calling me back Tuesday. The service has been disgusting, and shocking! Lack of ownership, wrong information and advice given. just AVOID! # TERRIBLE SERVICE!",Negative,-0.200868056

Vodafone,46,GB,1,2 Years and a Nightmare story to carry out a basic upgrade,11-Jan-24,af1cfc92-3455-46d6-98f1-443ec9711be1,"Dear Vodafone Complaints Manager,I am writing to you to raise an issue about: Home BroadbandThe issue that I have experienced was: 1) On the 11th December 2023: I received numerous suspicious emails regarding my new order / upgrading.  Knowing that I had not placed any orders with vodafone, I spoke on live chat to confirm if any fraud had arisen on my account.  The order stating: Your plan: Migration Only Full Fibre - 80Order number: Order date: 11/Dec/2023 16:51:01After speaking with a live chat advisor, he told me that this is simply that all broadband providers are switching to full fibre lines and even if I changed provider they would be contacting me to do this.  So I allowed vodafone to keep this going and was stated a engineer would be out on 11th January 2024 at 1pm - 6pm.2) On the 31st December 2024: I called up Vodafone to hand in my 30 days notice as I was told this was needed to ensure not termination fees etc would be applied and I would be able to leave without any problems on the 18th January 2024, due to finding a better deal elsewhere.3) On the 2nd January 2024:  I saw via my online Vodafone account I had an upgrade line which was offering Full fibre 200 for £27 per month.  I decided to take out this offer via my account and this order was placed.  On the 8th January , i then got an email from Vodafone stating they were unable to process my order and a number to call to get in touch to discuss this issues. I called the number attached and spoke with a Tainen Jai, who confirmed the order was cancelled but was not sure why.  He told me that he would remove this order and place a new order for me and ensured I had the same deal offered to me.  Unfortunately Tainen Jai must of received some distressing news about his wife and told me he needed to rush through the terms and conditions and final parts as he needed to leave, which i understood  but also was worried everything had be done correctly.  After this phone call I received all my confirmation and everything seemed to be in correct order.4) Today (11th Jan 2024) aka Engineer Visit day to install Fibre lines: I received an email again stating, that they had cancelled the first broadband order (from the 2nd January) and that the engineer visit was also cancelled.  Initially this seemed correct as i knew my first upgrade order, was over written by Tainen Jai's order, but i was unsure whether this meant if the engineer visit for today (11th Jan 2024) to install purely the fibre lines was still going ahead.  So i called to up to make sure if this was still going ahead as I did not want to be waiting in the house for nothing.  After being on the phone for an hour, it now turns out that my new 2nd order (via Tainen Jai) was also cancelled - despite it showing 'in process' on the the tracking page.  I was then told that I would now have to place a 3rd order for it to go through.  Speaking with the upgrade team they also stated they could no longer offer me the upgrade plan of £27 per month but I had to pay £30 and then to add insult to injury they stated my landline number was disconnected and I would have to have a brand new number instead.  And that I need to call back on Wednesday 17th January to see if I can retain my old landline number or not. # 2 Years and a Nightmare story to carry out a basic upgrade",Positive,0.133582251

You can imagine our frustration when the actual speed was as low as 2Mbps. Sometimes the connection is so poor that we lose it altogether. After a 5-week nightmare trying to engage with their “support”, they finally admitted that their product is not fit for service. However they made it clear that this was our fault. Our property is not suited to their package. We should have been aware of this when we signed up.It gets worse. They also told us that this is a common problem with their package. They know that this is an issue, yet they continue to advertise their package without a health warning. Be aware that “up to 910Mbps” means anything from zero onwards. They knew that there was an issue with this package, but they subjected us to more than 4 hours of their gruelling “support”. The help centre is located overseas so the phone connection is appalling and it barely possible to make out what the “helper” is saying. They asked us, in barely comprehensible jargon, to carry out tests with equipment we didn’t have to verify what we had already told them. They assured that their system told them that everything up to the router was fine. Anything beyond that was our problem. The futility of these wasted hours defies description. It appears they deliberately make their “help” system so soul-destroying that eventually any complainants give up in despairIf you value your sanity avoid this company like the plague # Nightmare",Positive,0.041746032

Customer services insisted that an engineer (from Openreach) would need visit my property for the activation to be successful.The 11th of December comes around, however an engineer never came in the 5 hour time slot they advised! However I still got a message all work was complete and my system was working. It wasn’t!Long story short, after a week of investigation it was found the engineer had gone to the wrong property and installed my broadband at a random (incorrectly provided) address. The address was completely different to mine. It was checked by Vodafone and they confirmed the address I provided was recorded correctly in the system. Very strange.Due to the time of the month, a week before Christmas, Vodafone were unable to arrange or approve an engineer to visit to install my actual broadband until the 8th of January. Nearly one month after my first activation date!!After a long month of using mobile data the 8th of January finally approached.On the 7th of January, I received an automated text message from Openreach reminding me they will be coming to my property only to reference the incorrect address, again!! After reaching out to customer services they now inform me I will have to wait till January 22nd for my broadband to be installed, WITHOUT the need of an engineers visit like I first thought! On all occasions where Openreach were at ‘my property’ they were at the incorrect address. An absolute joke! Every time Vodafone spoke to me on the phone they said they would make sure the issue would be fixed and look to move the activation date forward as a priority. This has never happened!Hopefully the broadband will be installed and working on the 22nd and I will receive compensation for all the hassle and incomplete service. First time using Vodafone, so far I would not recommend to anyone. To make the service better, it would help if Vodafone could provide/reference the correct address to Openreach. # 1 month on, still no broadband.",Positive,0.07173913

I DON’T RECOMMEND VoDAFONE to anyone👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻We have moved our house and asked vodafone to transfer our broadband service to new address. The date on which engineer was supposed to come was 18th of December, but he didn’t turn up. Then I called vodafone and asked about the issue after waiting so long on call, they said due to x-mas holidays the engineer will come on 29th on December. On 28th of December, I received another msg from vodafone that engineer is not coming to fix the broadband tomorrow and we will update you soon. I rang vodafone and explained everything, they said now we wil send the engineer on 4th of January. Again I waited nobody came and was given doongle as replacement till then. I was told that I don’t have to pay for doongle untill my wifi get fixed. After that I was given another date of 11th of January. Today, I received msg from vodafone saying engineer not coming tomorrow. Also, they charged £60 from my account for doongle. Such a worst and sh!t company. So, I again rang them and after waiting 1 hour still didn’t receive any response. # Worst customer service and company",Negative,-0.293863636

When I walked in, there was only one person on the shop floor and she was sitting down using her mobile phone. After a few minutes she finally approached me. I wasn’t in the shop for more than half an hour and she mentioned twice that she was assistant store manager (whatever that means in a shop that small) and came across very unbothered and lazy, yet patronising (she spoke to me like I was a child) and spoke incredibly loudly.

Vodafone,27,GB,1,Inept. Incompetent. Utterly disrespectful,Updated 10 Jan 2024,07a84d17-3fce-478c-8abb-167280abce59,"I paid over £1000 for a new phone out of necessity (not choice) on Saturday. I was told it would connect on Tuesday. It still hasn't connected. I went through all the usual steps. Went online to get help. TOBi was as much use a chocolate teapot - kept sending verification codes to my disconnected number. Then started coming up with server errors. After 30 MINUTES I finally get connected to a person, who is speaking to so many complainants that it takes 5 MINUTES to answer every text (having been warned to send random texts every 2-3 minutes to keep us connected!?!) Only when I say cancel the order do I get some dedicated attention but 16 minutes in (total 46 MINUTES) and they have still done nothing to even find out what the problem is. Instead just messaging excuses. 22 MINUTES in (total 52 MINUTES) they tell me 'I have connect with my manager please allow me to share your issue' except they haven't even asked me what the issue is!?! ONE MINUTE LATER and I get a message 'We have not heard from you in quite some time. Seems like we have lost connection. I'll give it a minute more before I end this chat session.' Incredible! So they can have you sat waiting for 5 minutes for a reply but you get 1 minute!?!After a total of 61 MINUTES I get passed to a Resolution Manager. He STILL doesn't ask what the problem is though tells me 'I am aware of the situation' - except none of them are because they just don't ask me! After 64 MINUTES I finally get asked a first question. Having explained that I have carried over my number and SIM from my old Tesco Mobile Contract, I am then asked to confirm if I have put the new SIM in the new device; despite having clearly explained there is no New SIM but only the unlocked one. Having explained that it was unlocked with a PAC Code in the store. I am assured that I will not be charged for the connection downtime, but of course, the 1 HOUR and 15 MINUTES to still not get a resolution means I have lost more than 2 months rental equivalent in earnings. After 80 MINUTES I am finally told it is not possible to transfer the SIM over - I should have had a new one given to me and it will take 1-3 business days to send one. Incredibly, without going through 5 layers of security, they already have my address. Amazing that necessity is the mother of efficiency... I was told then that once my first bill is generated I can spend another 90 minutes trying to speak to someone to discuss compensation... Despite the fact that I am on the max, all in, super-duper plan which they know how much the bill will be. I refuse. I tell them to discuss it now. They insist they must order the SIM before discussing compensation. I foolishly agree and am offered a £10 Morrisons voucher in compensation. It is now 1 HOUR and 42 MINUTES I have spent trying to solve a 30 second problem...TIME is the most precious commodity we have as human beings. No amount of wealth or ingenuity can buy back WASTED TIME.In the 102 MINUTES I spent trying to sort out a pretty simple problem, 9053 peoples lives have ended... If nothing else, these inept, incompetent companies must respect and pay for peoples time; after all, we pay them for their time...UPDATE: Vodafone now want me to waste EVEN MORE TIME by recycling all of this on either of the following well-known  and incredibly well-respected (yes I'm being ironic) 'business' communications platforms, FACEBOOK and INSTAGRAM - which it seems will lead to a much speedier resolution than their own dynamic TOBi Artificial Indiot (AI) or through there own platform Chat Assistants. That says something! Even they don't rate their customers chances of a useful resolution through their own business platforms. Sadly, I have neither Facebook or Instagram and am not about to sign-up to either just to recycle this situation. Will be returning the phone on Saturday and cancelling the contract under 14 days right of cancellation. Completely INEPT. # Inept. Incompetent. Utterly disrespectful",Positive,0.129033678

So far 15 minutes on hold.... Call time over 40 mins so far!Agent finally returned to advise she spoke to technical help and they have adjusted the minimum speed gaurentee to 400 MbpsYet I signed up for 500 Mbps I accepted this as a temporary measure Ran some new tests and speeds now improved a little ranging for 170 to 237 MbpsStill not the 500 Mbps I signed up for and still not the speed gaurenteeWhy can't they just set my minimum speed to 500 Mbps the have the facility to do it!So far vodaphone fibre don't seem to be educated on the minimum speed gaurentee, let alone attempt to save me as a customer, we moved from sky and have to say is the worst decision we have made we will be moving back23rd Nov 240 Mbps DownloadedUPDATE, I have called to upgrade to 900Mbps and it now won't go over 260mbps fault number : FLT12203896They ran tests and then asked me to do various tests using LAN and WiFi etc which I done , I then sent screenshots as requested,I called again and spoke to a guy who said he had unblocked some stuff not sure what he meant but upload increased , yet download still no where near the 900mbps I can't even get over 300mbpsCalled again and new agent said he had to raise another fault , I advised I already done this! At this point I asked to cancel as going round in circles! He transfered me though to cancellations who advised I have to allow them 60 days to resolve the issue 60 days!!! So much for the minimum speed gaurentee I'm absolutely sick of this company and I implore anyone considering Vodafone fibre to think againBack to tech help from cancellations who advised they can't detect a fault so can't send an engineer, I advised if they can't give me the gaurenteed speed or send an engineer surely I can cancel! He passed me back to cancellations who advised I would get ETC charges I advised tech help can't send an engineer or fix the speed issue , but the cancellation advisor yet still ignored me and must be reading of a script , got passed back to tech help to do more tests at this point I have been on the phone over 2 hours and going round in circlesI have said I will call back next day , will update this review accordingly Why is it so hard to give a simple resolution to a end user , they can't send an engineer or fix the speed issue so surely they should have a process which will allow me to move to another provider without ETC chargesIt seems there is no communication between departments and vodaphone are very difficult to deal with # 500mbps and 900Mbps review",Negative,-0.041198255

My Router was delayed, DPD didn’t deliver and sent the original Vodafone router back to the depot, after hours speaking to Vodafone a router finally made its way to me. Before it was handed over to me the DPD driver asked for my old router so I gave them the BT one. This is where the problem started, they shouldn’t have taken my BT router and now after hours of discussion they have said they can’t sent it back leaving me with a £50 bill. As this wasn’t my fault I asked if I could be compensated in some way and nothing. Their manager can’t do anything and they deny being able to talk to the warehouse even though they told me they had and that my router was there. Apparently they can’t call the warehouse to put my router in a box for me to arrange for it to be picked up. The whole onboarding service has been rubbish and I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. Patch service some good people some not so good. I was told my router would be delivered back in 10 working days and that apparently was a lie.
